Two computer models were developed USIng the finite element and variable conductance approach to analyse, optimise and redesign the condensers. To validate these models, experiments were performed on both the condensers, installed on a domestic refrigerator that used refrigerant R134a as a working fluid. The experiments were carried out in an environmental chamber that maintained the ambient conditions at the desired temperatures of 200 C and 25 C and relative humidity of 60%.</dc:description><dc:description>Restricted Item.

It first identifies the shape and content of an ancient system of Christian thought predicated on the theology of the cross of Jesus Christ, and proposes the marks typifying its theologians.  Over against the ensuing hermeneutic it next finds the project of twentieth century Swiss theologian Karl Barth to exhibit many of the defining characteristics of this system, and Barth himself to be fairly deemed a modern theologian of the cross.  He crucially recovers, reshapes and reasserts the classical theologia crucis as a modern theological instrument, one answering enlightened theology’s self-glorifying accommodation to modernity with the living Word of the cross.

The crucicentric system itself is found to comprise two major theological dimensions, epistemological and soteriological.  Each of these comprises dialectically corresponding aspects connected with false and true creaturely glory.  The cruciform Word (or theology) speaking through this system likewise moves in two directions.  It declares negatively that any attempt by the creature to circumvent the cross so as to know about God directly, or to condition God's electing decision, is necessarily the attempt to know and act as God alone may know and act - an attempt therefore on the glory of God.  It declares positively that in the crucified Christ God formally discloses the knowledge of God, and determines the creature for God.  This knowledge and election are appropriated to the creature as, drawn into the cruciform environment, its attempt to glorify itself is negated and Christ's exalted humanity received in exchange.  Thence it is lifted to participate in Christ's mind and in his glory, a process guided by the Holy Spirit and completed eschatologically.

The database for this research includes selected primary materials in the Apostle Paul, Athanasius, a group of medieval mystical theologians, the reformer Martin Luther - particularly here his Heidelberg Disputation, and Karl Barth.  It also pays attention to the recent secondary literature peripherally or more concertedly connecting itself to the theology of the cross, of whatever period.  In this literature numerous suggestions for the content of the theology of the cross exist, a major methodological task in the current research being to bring these together systematically.  

To the extent that the inner structure of the system carrying the cruciform Word has not previously been made explicit, and Barth's crucicentric status not finally determined, in moving towards these achievements this dissertation breaks fresh ground.  In the process a new test by which to decide the crucicentric status of any theological project is developed, and a further and crucicentric way of reading Barth proposed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Rev.

source address. The ever-growing network traffic produces an enormous number of
flows. Recent studies attempt to simplify and mine flows in order to understand the
network’s behaviour. The traditional technique of packet aggregation to 5-tuple flows
provides understanding of the flows themselves, but fails to capture an understanding of
the aggregated end-point that generates flows: the IP host.
This thesis describes the design, development and analysis of a measurement method
that identifies an IP host from network traffic. A conceptual model of IP host
aggregations has been designed to summarize traffic: from 5-tuple to 2-tuple and finally
to 1-tuple IP host. Using the framework, various observations and analyses have been
conducted at the host level, including empirical distributions and behaviour
relationships.
Several host characteristics and applications are examined from real-world network
data, such as characterizing host interaction variability and identifying hosts that are
potentially significant.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Neville Brownlee</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Professor Brian E.

Translational inhibition, an innate antiviral defense mechanism that is utilised by, and most studied in, mammals, is proposed also to exist in plants. This mechanism is activated by the presence of double-stranded (ds) RNA, a necessary replication intermediate of RNA viruses, and relies on the phosphorylation of the α subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 by the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR). Phosphorylation of eIF2α results in the global inhibition of translational initiation in the host cell, and subsequently blocks the infection of the virus. Initial evidence supports the presence of a plant-functional homolog of PKR (pPKR), but no homologous sequence has so far been detected. The aim of this doctoral research was to identify pPKR via a proteomics approach using Arabidopsis thaliana, whereby the protein was first enriched as determined by the correlation of its activity, and then sequenced. The identification of pPKR would provide evidence for the presence of a novel antiviral defense mechanism in plants. The immobilised eIF2α peptide assay was developed, refined, and validated to allow the rapid detection and quantification of eIF2α phosphorylation activity in vitro. Flower buds from young Arabidopsis plants following light exposure (4 hr) had the highest eIF2α phosphorylation activity and ds but not single-stranded RNA activated this pPKR activity. Of the six different techniques used to enrich for pPKR from Arabidopsis, size exclusion chromatography was the most consistent. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins associated with kinase activity identified a number of RNA binding proteins and protein kinases, including calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs). The assessment of ions and chelators on putative pPKR activity revealed that eIF2α phosphorylation was activated in the presence of both calcium and the chelator ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines (15 of the 16 Arabidopsis dsRNA binding motif-containing genes, all 34 Arabidopsis CPKs, a kinase of unknown function, the eIF2α kinase GCN2, and the proposed plant-functional homolog of the mammalian PKR inhibitor p58IPK) were imported, and where possible, crossed to homozygosity and tested for eIF2α phosphorylation activity. Attempts were made to generate and test the eIF2α phosphorylation activity in nine transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing either mammalian PKR, an inhibitor of PKR, or a disrupted eIF2α. Of the 20 transgenic plant lines that could be tested, a statistically significant decrease in eIF2α phosphorylation activity was seen in the CPK19 T-DNA insertion line and p58IPK overexpression line. These two plants also had similarly stunted phenotypes. These findings provide evidence for CPK19 as the putative plant-functional homolog of PKR</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>MacDiarmid, Robin.</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Pearson, Mike.</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Taylor, John.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-03-01T01:18:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-01T01:18:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-01T01:20:59Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5678</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2082945</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In particular, it reflects on the supranational contexts in which (trans)national identities are negotiated and defined. Intellectual representations of Argentina and Mexico are offered by three Spaniards: Miguel de Unamuno, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and José María Albiñana Sanz. From the other side of the Atlantic, imaginative constructions of Spain are provided by five Latin Americans: Rubén Darío (Nicaragua), Alfonso Reyes (Mexico), and Manuel Ugarte, Ricardo Rojas and Manuel Gálvez, all from Argentina.
Spain’s newfound interest in its former colonies after 1898 was orchestrated in official circles through the ideology of hispanoamericanismo. As Spain’s postimperial project, intent on national regeneration and securing renewed influence by proclaiming the allegedly shared spirit uniting all Ibero-America, it sought a cultural reassertion of Spain’s hegemony. In contrast, while Peninsular regenerationists looked to rekindle their nation’s authority, the emergent hegemony of the United States drew Latin American intellectuals towards Spain. In consideration of their renewed mutual interests, this contextualised study traces what I deem are reciprocal gazes projected back and forth between Spain and the Americas, given that each is drawn to the other so as to reassess postimperial/postcolonial realities.
Although the Peninsular writers analysed in this study showed little faith in the rhetoric of hispanoamericanismo, I argue that their individual and national aspirations in Latin America are equally evident of Spain’s postimperial inability to approach the former colonies without reviving its imperial myths. In contrast, the recourse by Latin American intellectuals to Spain allows for an often overlooked opportunity to map the cultural significance that the ex-Metropolis held for them, articulated in response to the threat of US cultural and economic neoimperialism and what were perceived as the ill effects of modernity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2010-03-04T02:13:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-04T02:13:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-04T02:13:31Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Spanish)--University of Auckland, 2009.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5684</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1962629</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

its explicit aim of Sustainable Development (SD). The argument developed is that with increasing
levels of theoretical and practical interest in Strong Sustainability (SS), the current, largely
retrospective model of SEA, and its application need to be re-envisioned. The thesis therefore
improves this existing model of SEA to ensure greater sensitivity to concerns for stronger
sustainability. The new model is referred to as Strategic Sustainability Development (SSD). This
model is tested against the current Auckland Regional Growth Strategy (ARGS) to determine
whether an SEA model, with explicit Strong Sustainability references can generate a workable
process for governments to achieve SD related goals. In particular, the new model is assessed to
see whether applying it to the issue of Climate Change would result in substantive environmental
gains in Auckland, New Zealand.
The ARGS as it stands in 2008 has taken a small but important step towards Sustainability by
recognizing the need for limiting spatial growth. To this end, the Auckland Regional Growth Forum
has instigated the creation of Auckland’s Metropolitan Urban Limit and internal growth
conurbations. These developments, while positive, will however fail to address the key
environmental issues facing Auckland. The ARGS, by adopting a framework that conforms to the
standard of only Weak Sustainability, will continue to encourage a social and economic growth
discourse that promotes unsustainable consumption, social dysfunction, and environmental
problems such as air pollution. This thesis therefore argues that the ARGS should employ a model
of SEA based on SS, namely the model developed in this thesis, SSD. Had a model such as SSD
been applied to Auckland’s development over the last decade, significant positive environmental
outcomes may have been achieved. Recent developments, such as the signing of the Kyoto
Protocol, represent a qualitative change in the way environmental issues are now taken seriously
by governments and publics alike. Environmentalism has thus reached a tipping point where
governments clearly have a mandate to give substantive attention to environmental issues. This
thesis provides a clear model that can be applied by governments to achieve sustainable
environmental outcomes.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Tom Fookes</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-03-18T23:11:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-18T23:11:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5723</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2047944</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

It focuses on the transnational practices of participants from the Korean middle class in the recently created social field spanning the home country and New Zealand.
The aim of this research is to document the migration processes of Korean international migrants and to explore the meanings of this movement for the participants and the sending and receiving countries, drawing on the theoretical framework of transnationalism. This research is a multi-sited ethnography conducted in several cities in Korea and New Zealand. The main research method is life history interviews along with participant observation.
The research found that a new social field between the two countries has been created since New Zealand allowed mass immigration from Korea, and some Korean middle class have used this transnational social field to amass symbolic capitals for their status escalation and reproduction in Korea. As Korea had undergone rapid neo-liberal reform, after the economic crisis in 1997, this social field has been used by Koreans to access membership of another nation state which has a well-equipped welfare system and to gain entry to the education system in an English speaking country. In terms of settlement, these immigrants concentrate on achieving a transnational livelihood, building their community as part of the transnational social field where they can be embedded simultaneously in Korea while living in New Zealand. They adopt transnational and cosmopolitan identities to maximise their opportunities in this social field.
Korean international migration to New Zealand is one example of global population movement where people use transnationalism as a passage created by globalisation to cope with crises caused by globalisation itself. Here transnationalism is a deterritorialisation strategy against nation states’ monopolistic hegemony in defining their nationals’ social mobility channels.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Julie Park</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Changzoo Song</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-03-24T02:04:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-24T02:04:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-03-24T02:04:59Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5728</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2002234</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In particular, this thesis will focus on the textual analysis of four films shot in New Zealand:  The Piano (dir. Jane Campion, 1993),  Whale Rider (dir. Niki Caro, 2002) , The Last Samurai (dir. Edward Zwick, 2003), The Lord of the Rings trilogy (dir. Peter Jackson, 2001-2003). These primary texts are particularly relevant as they have all been used as marketing tools to attract tourists to New Zealand or specific locations within the country. This work draws upon an approach based on the theoretical premises of structuralist semiotics to investigate the way in which the selected films construct their viewers as potential tourists. The representation of space and characters in these texts can, in fact, generate an imaginative and cognitive activity that may, in turn, interpellate the physical and simulated mobility typical of tourist practice. The textual and semiotic analysis of selected film features is complemented by a historiographical overview of New Zealand cinema, which emphasizes the cultural, social and historical specificity of Aotearoa/New Zealand in the development of a 'national' film landscape. This perspective foregrounds the significance that the colonial past of the country has for New Zealand contemporary society. Thus, I argue that the conflation of a tourist gaze with a filmic one is rooted in the colonial history of New Zealand cinema. In turn, the affinity between the modes of vision of both the tourist and the settler is determined by their common need to make sense of an unfamiliar land by framing it within familiar conventions. The thesis also investigates the strategies adopted by local tourist authorities in order to promote each film and its film locations. This is supported by the analysis of selected tourist products,  tourist circuits, guidebooks, brochures and sites, related to the four case studies. More broadly, the examination of these texts is linked to a discussion of the relationship between film and tourist discourses.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document is restricted to authenticated members of The University of Auckland only until Nov. 2014</dc:description><dc:description>Thesis now published as a book.

However, provision of home care is fraught with quality issues such as high staff turnover rates, inadequate staff training, a lack of coordinator support and reduced continuity of care. Consequently, ensuring the sustainability of home care services remains a critical area of concern. Objective: To evaluate the impact of a restorative home care service, for older people with varying levels of need, in relation to improving quality and sustainability. Design: Randomised controlled trial with cluster randomisation. Older people and their support workers were identified via a home care agency and cluster randomised to receive either the restorative home care service (intervention=93) or usual home care (control=93). Intervention: The restorative home care service involved goal facilitation, repetitive activity of daily living exercises, and an in-depth initial assessment for older people; experiential training for support workers; care management role and enhanced skill and competency level for the coordinator. Participants: Older people (65+ years), living in their own homes, who received assistance from a home care agency in South Auckland, New Zealand. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with older people at baseline, four and seven months. The primary outcome was change in health related quality of life measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Other scale measurements were utilised to assess physical, mental and social wellbeing. Informal carer stress was assessed with the Carer Reaction Assessment. Focus groups were held with support workers at baseline and 14 months to ascertain their opinions. Coordinator perceptions were established via one-on-one interviews at 14 months. A basic comparison of costs for the two groups was undertaken. Results: Compared with usual care, restorative home care demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in health related quality of life over time for older people (P=0.05). There were no changes in other scale measurements for older people in both groups over time. Support worker turnover was 42.5 and 17.9 percent for the control and intervention group, respectively, and job satisfaction improved within the intervention group in comparison to the control group. Value adding costs increased, while, non-value adding costs were reduced. Key aspects of the intervention contributing to these findings included goal facilitation and development of personalised support plans, the coordinators enhanced input and support and the improved training for support workers.  Conclusions: This study demonstrated a restorative home care service can enhance the quality of service provision to benefit both older people and support worker staff. Further amendments are addressed, such as improving support worker employment conditions and raising the eligibility criteria for home care, to ensure future sustainability.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Matthew Parsons</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Elizabeth Robinson</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-04-26T23:39:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-04-26T23:39:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-04-26T23:39:44Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5765</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2002818</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated..</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Over 1000 individuals were collected at six locations across ~13o of latitude, and an age-based approach was used to establish the patterns of variation in growth rate, size-at-age, development rate (size- and age at- maturity and -at-sex change), life span, and rate of physiological ageing. Firstly, an otolithbased ageing procedure was developed following successful validation of the daily and annual periodicity of opaque zone formation, and histological analysis of the reproductive biology of O. pullus was combined with sex-specific demographic information to establish a diagnosis of monandric protogynous sex change. Secondly, a 'biota-environment linkage' approach was used to explore the patterns of geographic variation in life history and the effects of potential underlying environmental factors (sea surface temperature, species density, habitat and food availability, exposure, and extrinsic mortality). Significant latitudinal trends in growth, body size, development, and longevity were identified along a broad North -  South gradient, with individuals growing slower, maturing and changing sex later, achieving larger body sizes and living longer at higher latitudes. The main effects of latitude on the phenotypic response of life histories were related to the latitudinal gradient in environmental temperature. Species density and habitat (food) availability also affected the responses in body size and development, and these effects were detected on a local spatial scale. Comparison with a temperate carnivorous labrid, Notolabrus fucicola, revealed no differences in the response of growth, body size, development and life span to temperature in the two species with contrasting diets, thus providing no support for the hypothesis of a temperature constraint on herbivory at high latitudes in O. pullus. Lastly, the processes underlying latitudinal changes in life span were investigated in the context of the oxidative stress hypothesis of ageing and of the predictions of the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, and the age-pigment neurolipofuscin was quantified in older O. pullus individuals to assess the rate of oxidative damage accumulation across latitudes. Neurolipofuscin accumulation rate increased with temperature, indicating that a slower rate of ageing contributed to greater life expectancies at colder temperatures</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Choat, Howard</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Clements, Kendall</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Raubenheimer, David</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-06-01T09:13:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-01T09:13:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-01T09:13:03Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5806</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2039961</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Passive tags are used in commercial offices for access control, while a more active and powerful tag is deployed in highways for electronic road toll collections. Other non-contact, close range methods are popular in subways and other public transport systems.  The use of RFID in supply chain management is an emerging technological trend that has attracted a lot of attention in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. This is largely driven by the potential benefits that RFID technology is perceived to deliver in the supply chain, particularly, supply chain visibility. Major retailers and leading corporations around the globe are already testing and implementing RFID, and claiming to have achieved competitive advantages and return on their investments. It is, therefore, important to understand the adoption of RFID in New Zealand supply chains, so that appropriate actions can be taken to ensure that New Zealand companies are not lagging behind.  This research study explores and explains the adoption of RFID in supply chains using exploratory survey and case study. The research questions are:  1. What specific benefits can be achieved in organisations by using RFID?  2. What are the barriers to realising these benefits?  3. How and why do organisations adopt or not adopt RFID in supply chains?  Three factors were found to be important in the adoption of RFID in New Zealand supply chains. They are the compatibility of RFID with existing organisation's systems and values, the availability of supports to facilitate RFID adoption, and the readiness of the internal and external organisation's environment. It was also found that complexity of the technology and the relative advantage of using RFID were to a certain extent influencing users' perception of RFID compatibility. Dependency on trading partners was found to have some effects on RFID adoption.  A theoretical framework of RFID adoption in supply chains is proposed. This framework helps to bring out the important factors in the adoption of RFID in supply chains. While most IS research is focused on individual technology adoption or on intra-organisational technology adoption, this research is focused on technology adoption that involves or has impacts on trading partners, that is, at supply chain level. It provides a three-dimensional evaluation framework which includes technological, organisational, and environmental aspects of inter-organisational technology adoption.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2010-06-02T02:14:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-02T02:14:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-02T02:14:47Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5807</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2041003</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In addition maintenance of body protein stores is also critical and there is a well known relationship between energy and protein balance. The establishment of any relationship between energy and protein balance and markers of overtraining in endurance athletes is also beneficial for endurance performance.  Purpose and Aims  The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effects of endurance exercise on energy balance and protein balance. The aims were to establish accurate values for EI, EE and protein balance in two endurance sports, Road Cycling and Ironman. The rationale was to determine whether endurance athletes are able to maintain energy and protein balance over periods of increased EE and whether parameters of energy and protein balance related to markers of overtraining  Methods  Two research projects were conducted, the first at the Tour of Southland cycle event (5 high performance male cyclists) and the second at an Ironman training camp (7 male Ironman athletes). In both studies EE was determined by the DLW technique and EI by supervised weighed diet records. Protein balance was determined by an 18-hour primed continuous infusion of 13C-leucine at the Tour of Southland and via the traditional 24-hour nitrogen balance technique at the Ironman camp. Both techniques were performed prior to and immediately after the given event. Nude body weight, blood overtraining parameters, urine samples and a mood questionnaire were collected in the mornings for analysis of daily parameters.  Results  The Tour of Southland: Subjects maintained energy balance with a mean EI of 27.3±3.8 MJ/day and a mean EE of 27.4 ± 2.0 MJ/day. There was no significant change in protein breakdown or parameters of overtraining. Ironman Training Camp: Athletes maintained energy balance with a mean EI of 20.27±2.91 MJ/day and a mean EE of 20.5±3.4 MJ/day and nitrogen balance was positive. There were indications of a relationship between energy and protein balance and markers of overtraining in both studies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr Lindsay Plank</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-06-08T01:16:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-08T01:16:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-08T01:16:49Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5811</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2030491</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Understanding this is important for these and other businesses  that want to succeed economically and realise their potential to contribute to all their  stakeholders. Addressing this question involved critiquing the reifying tendencies in the  tourism marketing and production system and exploring ways in which authenticity and  sustainability, two of the most prominent themes in academic tourism discourse yet rarely  engaged with together in academic literature, might conjointly contribute to creating  well-being through cultural tourism within explicitly Māori terms. This supply-side  perspective has not previously been explicitly explored.  Informed by Māori research principles and sharing features with the grounded theory  approach, four holistic, in-depth case studies of Māori cultural tourism businesses  generated a relational Five Well-beings map and twenty-five practices to demonstrate  how Māori cultural tourism businesses create authentic and sustainable spiritual, cultural,  social, environmental, and economic well-being.  The Well-beings map offers an explicit, cosmological, and holistic analysis that describes  how mauri ora, meaning conscious well-being, is achieved through reciprocal  relationships of respect that are informed by Māori values, and applied through praxis  that transforms tourism contexts into sites of multi-dimensional well-being. The key  facets of this approach are that: authenticity and sustainability are reflexively constructed  in relationship; a spiritual outlook is central; wealth is an outcome of well-being; a Māori  mode of exchange is operational; a relational approach militates against the forces of  reification; and value is embodied in relationships which create added value for the firm.  The Well-beings approach is illuminated further using the wider literature, bringing an  ethic of care and respect framework together with a stakeholder theory of the firm  ii  focussed on the intrinsic value of stakeholders, and drawing on Heidegger’s concepts of  being-in-the-world and care.  Māramatanga, meaning enlightenment, is depicted as the realisation of ever-present  potential and is the tupu, the unfolding of each person’s potential, that can occur through  the transformational power of Māori cultural tourism in which customers, employees,  suppliers, and other business stakeholders including social, cultural, and environmental  communities experience how Māori cultural tourism businesses create authentic and  sustainable well-being.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr. Ljiljana Erakovic</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr. Manuka Henare</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-06-14T09:01:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-14T09:01:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-14T09:01:48Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5818</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2053861</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Despite  this, long serving market-oriented governments still suffer from the same degenerative tendencies  that have spoiled the public's perception of many long serving governments over the last fifty to  sixty years. As a result, many of these government's, and in particular their leaders, have not lasted  longer than eight or nine years in office. So, through comparative analysis of how two long serving  market-oriented governments attempted to deal with their most obvious degenerative tendencies,  this thesis sets out to see if and how a long serving market-oriented governing party can rejuvenate  their product after more than seven years in office. The results of the analysis do suggest that long  serving market-oriented governments can halt and reverse the growing public dissatisfaction for  their product that inevitably occurs over time. However, due to variables external and  uncontrollable to the party, this may not lead to further election victories. While this answer is not  as conclusive as would be desirable, by outlining new strategies these governments may use to  combat the problem noted, the results of this thesis do advance research in the field of product  rejuvenation for governments that entered office under a market-orientation.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Lees-Marshment, Jennifer</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Miller, Raymond</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-06-25T02:11:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-25T02:11:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-06-25T02:11:14Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5830</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2079722</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

However, optimal levels of 25(OH)D are uncertain, with some cross-sectional studies suggesting optimal levels of &gt;75 nmol/L. This thesis assessed optimal levels of vitamin D and strategies for its supplementation.
In a trial of high-dose vitamin D3
regimens in frail elderly, data suggest that 25(OH)D levels of 40 – 50 nmol/L may be sufficient. In the same study, calcium intake appeared to modify the relationship between 25(OH)D and PTH and subsequent estimates of optimal 25(OH)D based on these data may be lower when calcium intake is &gt;1552 mg/day. It was also noted that large loading doses (500 000 IU) rapidly normalise 25(OH)D levels, whilst monthly 50 000 IU doses were also effective but took 3 – 5 months to reach plateau.
An analysis of adverse events recorded for a 5-year calcium trial in postmenopausal women showed that whilst season-adjusted baseline 25(OH)D levels &lt;50 nmol/L increased the risk of stroke and a composite event (stroke, myocardial infarcton or sudden death) compared to levels ≥50 nmol/L, these effects disappeared when adjustment for baseline confounders was made.
Data from two studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is prevalent amongst urban Chinese women of childbearing age, and that in the Auckland region young Maori and Pacific women and children and adults of Middle Eastern, Southern Asian and African ethnicity are over-represented in the group of people identified as vitamin D deficient or insufficient. In a final study of middle-aged and older New Zealand men, more than half (55%) reported use of dietary supplements which may make a contribution to vitamin D status.
In conclusion, data here suggest that 25(OH)D levels of 50 nmol/L may be satisfactory for bone health, that large loading doses of vitamin D3 are safe with respect to hypercalcaemia and effective, and that a number of non-elderly populations are at high risk of having insufficient vitamin D status.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Ian Reid</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-07-01T22:23:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-07-01T22:23:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2010-07-01T22:23:49Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5835</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2032976</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Its purpose is to unravel the way in which their corpus, from deeply seated feminist convictions, contributes to the renovation of the genre of narrative. This genre has always been characterized in Galicia by its slow and anomalous development, given that there are very few female narrative writers until the 1980s. However, as will be seen, the evolution of the genre will bear fruit in a qualitative and quantitative increase in female narrative writers in the new millennium. The first generation consists of Xohana Torres (Santiago de Compostela, 1931-) and María Xosé Queizán (Vigo, 1939-), who begin to publish under the Franco regime. The second is that composed by Carmen Blanco (Lugo, 1954-) and Teresa Moure (c. 1969-), who initiate their literary careers in the democratic period, publishing their narrative works from 2004 onwards. An analysis of their narrative production will reveal how innovative and original it was at the time of publication. This innovation is evident in different aspects, such as the introduction of subversive themes and characters, original structures or the use of other literary genres, such as the fairy tale and feminized quest romance. I will examine how Torres, who publishes her only novel in 1971, articulates a strong critique of Francoism and its basic tenets through her adolescent protagonist, Maxa, to reclaim a rural Galicia destroyed by capitalist exploitation. In Queizán's novels, controversial themes, such as motherhood, paedophilia and alternative sexualities, have led to the silencing of her works. As for Blanco's texts, they rewrite traditional fairy tales to effect a penetrating analysis of Galicia, reviewing its past and present. Such recreations proclaim the deep yearning for a libertarian dream in which Galicia might be an egalitarian place for all men and women. Finally, Moure's narrative defends the 'nature' of women, in keeping with her ecofeminist stance. For all these feminist writers, the equation of women with an autonomous Galicia is the fundamental thread woven through the entirety of their work.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Arkinstall, Christine</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Zaza, Wendy-Llyn</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-07-02T02:47:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-07-02T02:47:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2010-07-02T02:47:10Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5836</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2040208</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

identifying genetic and environmental factors which are associated with
myopia development in the Labrador Retriever.
Methods: A large pedigree of Labrador Retrievers was phenotyped for refractive error.
Using statistical (familial aggregation) analysis, refractive error data was used
to investigate the inheritance of the trait within the pedigree. DNA samples
were taken for later analysis. Potential environmental factors early in life were
also studied in relation to adult refractive error; including birth weight, growth
rate, season of birth, ocular pathology and litter size. DNA samples were
extracted and a pilot genetic association study was designed to identify genetic
loci for canine refractive error using a genome wide SNP array with a myopic
case group and a non-myopic control group.
Results: A significant prevalence (37%) of myopia was found within the pedigree
studied. Familial aggregation analysis demonstrated a significant genetic
contribution, as well as showing a strong environmental contribution.
Heritability of refractive error was 0.506. Smaller litters were shown to have
significantly higher levels of myopia. No association was found between any
environmental factors and adult refractive error, apart from season of birth in
one age tertile. A genetic pilot study was designed to test for genetic loci
which contribute to canine refractive error.
Conclusions: The Labrador Retriever is potentially an ideal animal model for the study of
human myopia; the condition is naturally occurring in dogs, develops in a
significant proportion of the population and can be phenotyped noninvasively.
This study is the first to demonstrate the inheritance of myopia in
any animal other than humans. The dog genome allows for myopia to be
studied at a molecular level and due to the domesticated nature of the dog,
breeding and environmental manipulations can also be conducted to identify
further aspects of myopia causatio</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2010-07-13T23:44:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-07-13T23:44:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-07-13T23:44:07Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5847</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2037970</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The Youth2000
survey indicated that around 9.0% of male and 18% of female secondary school
students reported feeling depressed. School Guidance Counsellors (SGCs) are ideally
placed to identify, assess and treat these adolescents. However, SGCs are rarely
included in mental health research.
I investigated the beliefs, knowledge and practice of SGCs around adolescent
depression. There were three stages to the research. Stage One used a qualitative
approach, with nine focus groups held in Auckland in 2004. Fifty-two SGCs
participated. I developed a thematic map from the results that emerged. Category One
“Beliefs and Knowledge” had three themes: causes, negative connotations and
different presentations. Category Two “Practice” had five themes: assessment,
referrals, effective therapy, systems and training needs.
Stage Two comprised a questionnaire based on these results. This investigated SGCs’
knowledge of depression, assessment, training and referral decisions. It also requested
demographic data. In 2005, this was sent to 455 SGCs throughout New Zealand. Two
hundred and forty SGCs (53%) responded. Eighty percent did not believe that their
initial training equipped them adequately to work with mild to moderately depressed
adolescents. SGCs wanted further training, especially appropriate strategies. They
requested information based on research and presented by clinicians.
In Stage Three, I developed a training workshop on assessment, referral and treatment
of adolescent depression, tailored to SGCs’ needs. Thirty-nine SGCs attended
workshops in 2006. Evaluations were positive and indicated that this training was
appropriate and useful. SGCs would recommend the workshop to others.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study are discussed and recommendations made
about future developments. There is emphasis on the need for policy to encourage
collaboration between SGCs and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services
(CAMHS), education and health, training providers and the New Zealand Association
of Counsellors. As SGCs are placed outside both teaching and health, they need to be
adequately trained and receive regular professional development, supervision and
consultation around depression. CAMHS are well placed to offer training to SGCs
based on identified needs and evidence-based practice.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr Simon Hatcher</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Amndy Parkin</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-08-01T21:23:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-01T21:23:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-01T21:23:13Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5892</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2046367</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

It relies on data generated through qualitative
research methods and provides thick descriptions‘ of how the role works in practice as
forensic psychiatrists, together with the instructing lawyers, construct the defence. Multiple
data sources were accessed, including thirty-one interviews with lawyers and forensic
psychiatrists, observation of a high profile criminal case, and interpretation of clinical and
legal texts. The research extends the existing medico-legal literature that has studied the
relationship between psychiatry and law and provides analysis which contributes to current
debates around the use of psychiatric expertise in cases of insanity.
Drawing on contemporary socio-legal studies, the research focuses on the hybrid nature of
the insanity defence, the hybrid expertise forensic psychiatrists‘ practise as expert witnesses,
and the symbiotic relationship between lawyers and forensic psychiatrists that occurs in this
context. This thesis argues that the insanity defence is a hybrid construct that brings lawyers
and forensic psychiatrists together in such a way that the boundaries, which should ideally
define their discrete functions, become blurred. The way the insanity defence shapes forensic
psychiatrists‘ practices, and the relationship between lawyers and forensic psychiatrists, is
also explored. The forensic psychiatrists‘ practices are shown to be inextricably linked to the
legal requirements for an expert witness and the defence of insanity. From this perspective,
the forensic psychiatrists are not ―doing psychiatry‖ as they would in a therapeutic setting,
but rather they practise a hybridised expertise that reflects the hybrid nature of the insanity
defence. The symbiotic relationship that occurs in practice as lawyers and psychiatrists make a case for insanity is demonstrated. This implicates lawyers in the production of effective expert testimony and illustrates how the defence of insanity is co-produced by both professionals in the courtroom.
This thesis highlights how the boundaries that aim to separate the responsibilities of forensic
psychiatrists, lawyers and fact-finders become blurred in practice. It contends that these
findings have significant implications for not only the continued use of forensic psychiatrists in cases of insanity, but also public understandings of madness.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Mary Finlayson</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Brian McKenna</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-08-04T00:30:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-04T00:30:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-04T00:30:10Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5898</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2045968</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

These organisms multiply rapidly, promote assemblage development and are present in the mature biofilm community. The purpose of this research was to identify and describe such fresh water biofilm bacteria, and to investigate cell and metabolite-level interactions between these organisms which contribute to mixed community formation. A subset of bacteria which displayed enhanced colonisation properties was selected from isolates which were well represented in culturable and molecular 16s rRNA gene-based databases of the stream biofilm culture collection. This included two Janthinobacterium lividum isolates (JL1 and JL2), Pseudomonas costantinii (PC), Pseudomonas syringae (PS), and Serratia plymuthica (SP) species. Each isolate displayed characteristic properties in terms of mono species biofilm structure in low nutrient media, JL1 (fluffy ball-shaped microcolonies and thin undifferentiated biofilm component), JL2 (thick undifferentiated sheet-like biofilm), PC (tower-shaped microcolonies), PS (sheet-like biofilm with well-organised voids and spaces) and SP (flat undifferentiated biofilm with good surface coverage). Population-level responses of pioneer biofilm bacteria to co-culture with a second strain were studied in detail using two defined pairs of bacteria. The first pair, SP and JL1 demonstrated that component colonies grew together and allowed ready mixing of individual populations. The pair of SP and PS consistently maintained a clear separation of colony growth zones. Microscopic analysis of cell-level arrangements of SP and JL1 (organisms detected by Gamma and Beta proteobacteria probe specific fluorescent in situ hybridization respectively) showed that both bacteria maintained their mono culture structures in co-culture, and suggests that the presence of a partner did not change the overall macroscopic biofilm appearance of either strain. The co-culture biofilm of SP and PS bacteria (differentially red and green fluorescent protein labelled) showed SP cells restricted to zones within the PS-dominated biofilm, suggesting PS maintained its overall matrix structure at the expense of SP. Extracellular metabolite profiling of SP and JL1 showed unique profiles in each mono culture. The co-culture included most of the components of the metabolite profiles of each isolate but at reduced levels. Metabolic profiles and reconstructed metabolic pathways based on metabolite output suggest possible cross-feeding in co-culture and a co-operative interaction between isolates. Extracellular metabolites of SP and PS showed differences in mono culture. The coiii culture metabolite profile was more similar to that of PS than SP, and, some molecules were present at levels higher than the PS mono culture. Nature of secreted metabolites and reconstructed metabolic pathways suggest that the interaction between bacteria of this pair was highly competitive and involved the production of inhibitory molecules. Interspecies interactions amongst bacteria are known to be important in structuring biofilms and this research provides further knowledge into the complex web of inter bacterial interactions that influence the development of multi-species biofilm communities.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Gillian Lewis</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Silas Villas-Boras</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-08-05T00:10:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-05T00:10:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-05T00:10:20Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5900</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2039940</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

New Zealand (NZ) triplefin fishes (Tripterygiidae) have undergone a radiation associated with habitat diversification within NZ's coastal waters, where 26 closely-related endemic species occur in overlapping but divergent habitats, partitioned by depth and exposure. By investigating the relationship between respiratory physiological traits and habitat in these fishes, this thesis examines whether there is evidence in this group to support two proposed criteria for adaptive radiation; phenotype-environment correlation and trait utility. Significant interspecific differences were observed in rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) and critical oxygen concentration (O2 crit) in 12 species of triplefin examined. O2 crit correlated with species' habitat depth, with intertidal species displaying greater hypoxia tolerance than subtidal species, thus demonstrating phenotype-environment correlation and trait utility in relation to hypoxia exposure. Interspecific differences in VO2 were significantly influenced by phylogeny, indicating a lack of strong environmental selection on VO2. However, there was some indication of lower VO2 in species occupying more exposed habitats. Mitochondrial respiration was also examined in three species; the intertidal species displayed higher cytochrome c oxidase activity and was able to maintain efficient oxidative phosphorylation at higher temperatures than the two subtidal species, further indicating phenotype-environment correlation and trait utility. Haemoglobin (Hb) isoform expression was examined in 23 species. Isoform multiplicity declined with habitat depth, supporting the hypothesis that higher multiplicity may be associated with greater environmental variability. A lack of phylogenetic signal in Hb expression, and latitudinal variation in the relative isoform abundance in some species, indicated potential selection on this trait. However, there was no pattern in expression of cathodal Hbs, and the trait utility of this multiplicity is unknown. Overall, there is strong evidence that differences between intertidal and subtidal environments in exposure to high temperatures and hypoxia may have lead to divergence in O2 crit and mitochondrial function between intertidal and subtidal species. Therefore physiological adaptation may have enabled the expansion of species into the more demanding habitats such as the intertidal zone. Hb isoform multiplicity and VO2 were correlated with habitat in both intertidal and subtidal species, however the trait utility associated with these correlations is unknown and thus there remains a lack of evidence to support a direct role of physiological adaptation in habitat divergence of subtidal species - and therefore for adaptive radiation of the group as a whole.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Assistant Professor Kendall Clements</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Tony Hickey</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Professor Rufus Wells</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-08-08T22:22:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-08T22:22:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-08T22:22:22Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5902</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2040750</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The aim of this work was to decide on optimum reinjection strategies  for various types of geothermal systems.  First an idealized 3D closed model used by Sigurdsson et al. (1995) is extended to  examine the effect of the natural recharge from groundwater, from the basement  and laterally from the boundaries of the system. The results show that injection  increases steam flow if recharge is small because the reservoir is acting as a  closed system, or if the caprock is permeable and allows groundwater recharge.  Otherwise injection may cause a decrease in steam production by suppressing hot  recharge from depth or replacing lateral recharge by colder injected water.  For hot-water reservoirs the effect of different well configurations on the  production performance is examined with a model of the East Mesa field and the  results show that deep far-infield reinjection provides an optimum strategy that  supports reservoir pressures without causing an early thermal breakthrough.  The impacts of different rates of infield and outfield reinjection on two-phase  liquid-dominated reservoirs are investigated by using a model of Wairakei-  Tauhara. The results show that outfield reinjection is a safe method for disposing  of water. A high rate of infield reinjection prevents boiling in the reservoir and  causes a drop in the production enthalpies. A significant decline occurs in the  surface features which are close to the injection zones. Reinjection infield of 25%  of the separated geothermal water appears to be a good strategy since it does not  cause a significant pressure or temperature decrease.  For two-phase vapour-dominated reservoirs reinjection impacts on steam  production are investigated by using a model of Darajat. Investigation of various  production/reinjection schemes show that; reinjecting 50% of the condensate  above the production zones increases steam production significantly. However  for higher reinjection rates, the steam production rate may decline owing to the  breakthrough of cold reinjected water. If the production zones are deeper,  reinjection is much more beneficial. Introducing a larger number of production  and reinjection wells scattered throughout the field increases the reservoir life.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Michael J.

Cost-effective techniques that can be used to prepare structures with controllable  compositional, structural, and functional properties are fundamental to the utilization of ZnO  in small scale devices with enhanced performance. Although many methods have been  developed to fabricate ZnO nanostructures, systematic research on functional materials  development based on ZnO is still needed as this fascinating material probably has the richest  family of low-dimensional nanostructures.  The research reported in this thesis aims to develop ZnO-based nanostructural materials  using a facile and low-temperature aqueous solution growth approach, to analyze their  compositional, mechanical, structural, and functional properties using advanced  characterization techniques, to get a better understanding of the mechanisms behind  nanostructure growth, and to explore their potentials in catalytic, optical, and electronic  applications.  In the first part of this thesis, low-dimensional ZnO nano-/micro-rods with tailored  structural property (growth direction, aspect ratio, and surface distribution density) were  grown on glass substrates in aqueous solutions containing zinc salt and  hexamethylenetetramine at temperatures generally lower than 95oC. The substrates were  pre-deposited with a thin layer of ZnO seeds using a magnetron sputter. The potential  influences of growth conditions, typically including concentration, pH, type of zinc salt,  solution temperature, reaction duration, and inorganic or organic additive, have been  subjected to systematic investigation. This led to an improved understanding of the chemical  reactions and nucleation/growth processes involved in the morphological evolution of  ZnO-based hierarchical nanostructures.  The second part of the thesis, ZnO nano-/micro-rod arrays with controllable distribution  density have been successfully synthesized by adjusting the initial pH of the weak acidic  growth solution. ZnO arrays with a large inter-rod space provide a good opportunity for characterizing the property of an individual rod. In this research, mechanical property tests  have been successfully peformed directly on a single rod without the need of any complicated  sample preparation. The electronic properties of these aligned ZnO nanorod arrays have also  been explored by studying the I-V characteristics of both heterojuction and homojuction p-n  devices.  In next two chapters, complex ZnO structures, including nanotubes and  three-dimensional ball-shaped clusters have been presented and disscussed, respectively. The  morphology and microstructure of these structures were characterized by scanning electron  microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and in-situ cathodoluminescence. The  corresponding growth mechanisms were proposed based on the analysis of the  characterization results.  Chapter 7 describes that aligned ZnO nano-rod arrays were further used as templates to  prepare a novel composite nanostructure. By coating these ZnO nanorods with TiO2  nanowires using magnetron sputtering technique, a ZnO/TiO2 core-brush structure has been  successfully achieved. Their morphology and microstructure have been investigated using  scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray  diffractometer, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.  This composite nanostructure shows a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in  decomposition of a typical organic dye under UV and sunlight irradiation. This new structure  has many other interesting properties and may have great potential in other optoelectronic  applications.  In the last part of this thesis, conclutions and future works are addressed according to the  synthesis, characterization and application results.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Wei Gao</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr. Michael A.

Although our primary focus is calibrating computer models of  geothermal reservoirs, the methodology we have developed can be applied to a wide  range of computer model calibration problems.  In this study, the Bayesian framework is employed to construct the posterior  distribution over all model parameters consistent with the measured data, accounting  for various uncertainties in the calibration process. To construct the posterior  distribution for computer model calibration problems, several methods such as the  additive bias framework of Kennedy and O'Hagan (2001) and the enhanced error  model (Kaipio and Somersalo, 2007) are investigated.  Then, the solutions of computer model calibration problems are given by estimating  the expected value of statistics of interest over the posterior distribution.  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm  (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970) in particular, is empoyed to explore  the posterior distribution, and Monte Carlo integration is used to calculating the  expected values.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Colin Fox</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Michael O'Sullivan</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-08-31T01:25:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-31T01:25:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-08-31T01:25:44Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5944</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2048117</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Cellulose is the most highly abundant natural biopolymer on earth. However the utilisation of cellulose requires chemical modication or physical dissolution in a suitable solvent. Recently ionic liquids have become the solvent of choice for cellulose and other biopolymers. This is because of their unique solvency power and the desirable properties such as non-ammability, thermal stability, and recyclability. The use of cellulose/ionic liquid combinations not only supports the green chemistry concept but also helps in the development of sustainable resources which could be used as replacement for petroleum feed stocks. In this research ionic liquids were used to dissolve cellulose. The ionic liquids used in this study were 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-allyl-3- methylimidazolium chloride, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Rheology, heating FTIR and Raman studies were performed with ionic liquids and cellulose solutions to understand the properties of ionic liquids and cellulose solutions. The spectra from the heating studies were subjected to two dimensional correlation analyses. The rheology studies suggest that the ionic liquids themselves exist in two states, liquid state and a network state and the two dimensional analyses of the heating spectra reveals that the hydrogen bonding between C2H of the imidazolium ring, anion and moisture was responsible for this network formation. The cellulose was regenerated or fractionally precipitated from solutions using water, ethanol or acetonitrile as non-solvent. This investigation suggests that protic solvents like water and ethanol are good solvents for gel formation and acetonitrile is a desirable solvent for fractionation. The regenerated and fractionated cellulose samples were characterised by SEM, NMR, FTIR, XRD, DSC, TGA and SEC-MALLS analyses. Nano/sub-micron sized particles of cellulose were produced from the fractionation of cellulose from solutions in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. SEC-MALLS data indicate that fractionation according to molecular weight is possible with dilute solutions in ionic liquids. It was also observed that samples regenerated from solutions in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate were more ordered than the samples regenerated from chloride containing ionic liquids. These preliminary results show that the use of ionic liquids in the processing of cellulose has the potential to have many possible applications.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Mr. Neil Edmonds</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-09-02T23:14:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-09-02T23:14:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2010-09-02T23:14:55Z</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5949</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2049780</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

understanding of the critical pathophysiological factors that determine severity, drive
multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) and cause the high mortality. New treatment
paradigms are needed, and this thesis explores three paradigms that may offer novel
approaches to severity assessment and treatment.
Patients with acute pancreatitis are prone to hypotension and oxidative stress. Cyclic
voltammetry (CyV) was adapted to measure serum redox status during both
experimental AP and shock. CyV was found to accurately reflect disease severity.
Clinical trials are now needed to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this
approach at the bedside for real-time monitoring of the antioxidant capacity of
patients and response to resuscitation.
There is preliminary evidence to suggest that MODS might be mediated by toxic
factors in the protein fraction of disease conditioned mesenteric lymph (ML). Using
the advanced proteomic techniques of isobaric tags (iTRAQ™) for relative protein
quantitation together with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the
identification of the component proteins, the first comprehensive description of the
normal (fasted and fed) rodent ML proteome is provided in this thesis. This was
followed by separate studies to define ML proteome in AP and systemic shock. A
bioinformatics approach was applied to identify key pathways and significant proteinprotein
interactions.
The relatively new concept of cytopathic hypoxia has not been investigated in AP,
even though mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) plays a key role in the development of
MODS. Here, it was shown that significant MD was present, as expected, in the
pancreas and lung, but also in the jejunum early in AP. These findings justify the
further investigation of mitochondrial specific therapies in AP.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Prof. J.A.

An important aspect of successful chronic disease management is quality audit and feedback to  clinicians. However, due to the complex temporal relationships inherent in chronic disease,  formulating clinically relevant queries is difficult using the querying tools often built into  commercial practice management systems.  The onset of this PhD research involved working with staff of a general practice clinic to  develop a set of explicit quality audit indicators for blood pressure control. Eight indicators  were identified as most relevant to the practice. The ability to compute these indicators reliably  from routinely collected electronic medical records (EMRs) was validated by clinical panel  assessment. These eight indicators informed formulation of a model of chronic disease audit  with four broad classes of indicators: (1) persistence to indicated medication; (2) timely  measurement recording; (3) time to achieve target; and (4) measurement contraindicating  therapy.  The four broad indicator classes have been implemented within the ChronoMedIt  (Chronological Medical audIt) framework as an extensible and configurable architecture. The  main components of the ChronoMedIt architecture are: an XML based specification for  indicator formulation (with an associated XML-Schema), a drug and classification knowledge  base maintained using Semantic Web technologies, a C# based criteria processing engine, a  SQL-Server based patient database with related stored procedures and a graphical user  interface to formulate queries and generate reports. ChronoMedIt can produce patient-specific  audit reports as well as reports to benchmark an entire practice for a given evaluation period. A  visualisation tool has been developed to provide an alternate representation of patient  prescribing and measurement histories. By modifying the indicator specification and  knowledge base an analyst can address a wide array of chronic disease management queries as  specific instances of the four broad indicator classes. The framework's core computation has  been verified using redundant query implementations on a battery of simulated case data and is  illustrated against the EMRs of several practices. ChronoMedIt has been applied in several real-world settings; notably, identifying patients with  poor antihypertensive medication adherence profiles for a feasibility study of nurse-led  adherence promotion.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Prof. Jim Warren</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>A/Prof. Tim Kenealy</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-10-15T00:20:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-10-15T00:20:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6034</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2073145</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

To date there is no  commentary for the entire book and only brief commentaries for some of the individual  letters. A commentary on Book IV would be of use to scholars of Seneca and join the recent  commentaries on other books such as Richardson Hay's on Book I and Laudizi's on Book III.  The thesis has three introductory chapters. The first of these looks at how Seneca's  philosophical writing has been interpreted. It argues that the literary element in Seneca's  writing and his use of Latin are integral to his philosophy and cannot be removed to leave  some philosophical core that is readily pliant to reconstructing earlier Stoic thought from its  fragmentary remains. Furthermore, Seneca' s own opinions on writing and style offer a more  reliable guide to reading his work than forcing it to fit some modern literary theory. What  emerges from Seneca's writing when such prior agendas and assumptions are put aside is a  pragmatic philosophy written to appeal to the values of Seneca's Roman readers.  The second chapter argues from Book IV that the book divisions are relevant to the  organization of the Epistles. Firstly, one needs to be reminded of the sequential nature of the  collection, which Book IV illustrates well, as it marks a shift from the use of quotes to end  letters that had been a feature of the first three books. This is an aspect frequently lost in  excerpting. Then, the evidence is presented for Book IV being a unitary composition,  particularly through the thematic links between the two opening and two closing letters. The  third chapter lays out the scope of the commentary.  The commentary is organized with an introductory essay prefacing the commentary on  each epistle; this serves to compensate for the fragmenting tendency of the commentary as a  scholarly form. The emphasis in these essays and in the commentaries is to relate the letters  primarily to the wider context of Seneca's thought, and then secondarily to the broader  context of ancient philosophic and literary thought.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Wilson, Marcus</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-10-19T01:07:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-10-19T01:07:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6037</dc:identifier><dc:relation>UoA2123047</dc:relation><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Over the last three decades there has been  significant interest in more human-focused and intuitive qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning  (QSTR) methods, which address the inherent limitations of purely numerical approaches for  reasoning about space and time. However, despite the extremely significant theoretical advances  that have been made in the QSTR field, there is a distinct absence of commercial and industrial  applications that utilise QSTR calculi. The central issue is that relatively little research has  addressed the unique challenges of designing and developing QSTR-based applications in comparison  to more traditional systems that employ numerical processing techniques.  The primary objective of this thesis is to support software engineering practitioners in the  development of applications that utilise QSTR calculi. Five QSTR application case studies,  which cover a range of diverse application domains, are presented and analysed throughout  this thesis to motivate the development of effective methodologies. Furthermore, a comprehensive  definition of QSTR applications is presented to provide a formal basis for establishing  methodologies that address three major areas of QSTR application development: requirements  specification, design, and validation.  Design methodologies are presented that enable developers to evaluate the efficacy of numerous  QSTR calculi with respect to QSTR application functional requirements. Additionally,  the design methodologies adapt object-oriented concepts and machine learning techniques to  facilitate the development of custom, high level, application-specific qualitative relations and  constraints.  Four key validation methodologies are adapted from well known techniques in software  engineering: unit testing, integration testing, test coverage, and mutation testing. Furthermore,  a novel metric called H-complexity is presented and used to define four additional test coverage  classes that a developer can employ to assess the efficacy of a test suite.  Finally, a meta-validation methodology is established that enables developers and the QSTR  community to empirically investigate the efficacy of QSTR validation techniques. Experiments  are conducted using the meta-validation methodology and the results are analysed to identify  the most effective utilisation of QSTR validation methodologies according to the software development  process being employed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Assoc.

From the colonial project‘s drive to categorise and treat indigenous disorders, to postcolonial theorists‘ attempts
to understand the psychological effects of (de)colonisation, psychology has provided a lens
through which to investigate the (post)colonial condition. For the most part, these psychocolonial
investigations have focused on either the colonised or the coloniser, or on the
relation between them, thus remaining silent on the nature of the settler subject. Unwilling to
identify as the coloniser, and unable to identify as the colonised, the settler occupies an
ambivalent subject position, in which traditional psychological investigations of colonialism
are confounded. Furthermore, too often, postcolonial theorists have recourse to certain
pathologies, such as anxiety, melancholy or trauma, without a thorough awareness of the
intricacies of the disorder itself. This study is grounded in the belief that, when it comes to
understanding the psychical structure of the settler, we need to read colonial disorders anew.
With this in mind, my research returns to Lacanian psychoanalysis in order work through the
(post)colonial disorders of the settler subject. Lacanian analysis provides us with one of the
most complex languages through which to examine subjectivity and has a long history of
association with the discourse of (post)colonialism; it thus provides us with a point of reentry
through which to approach a psychoanalytic exploration of settlement.
This examination will be carried out through analysis of New Zealand settler narratives; in
particular, films that return to a specific time in New Zealand‘s early settlement period: the
New Zealand Wars (1843-1972). The Wars occurred in response to what many Māori
understood to be breaches in the Treaty of Waitangi (signed in 1840), and were instrumental
in forging the identities of both Māori and Pākehā as peoples. Narratives of the New Zealand
Wars have been repeated throughout New Zealand‘s cinematic history, and act as crucibles
for the formation of Pākehā (white settler) identity at the time of their making. As ‗veils of
fantasy‘ (in Slavoj Žižek‘s words), films provide us with a back-door into knowledge; by
paying attention to what is not said about colonial history, to the unspoken and the
unspeakable in these films, my research attempts to reveal something about the concealed
unconscious structure of the settler subject in New Zealand society.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Simmons, Laurence.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-11-23T00:56:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-11-23T00:56:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6076</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2069455</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

bioactive natural product. Penicillium sp. Pitna 4 is a fungus isolated from Berkeley Pit Lake, a metal
laden, pH 2.5 lake which formed when an abandoned copper mine in Butte, Montana filled with
infiltrating ground water. Berkelic acid is one of several bioactive natural products isolated from this
unlikely source and has been found to have desirable selective activity against the ovarian cancer cell
line OVCAR-3, as well as inhibitory activity against caspase-1 and matrix metalloprotease-3.
Synthetic access to this molecule is highly desirable due to its bioactivity and novel tetracyclic
structure as well as the fact that the planned bioremediation of Berkeley Pit Lake may eliminate its
natural source.
The synthetic studies undertaken have focused on developing a flexible strategy for the synthesis of
berkelic acid that allows for future modification to structure to allow investigation of biological activity.
The strategy is based on the use of a novel one-pot Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons/oxa-Michael
cascade to couple two advanced intermediates – a phosphonate and a lactol. A final
deprotection/spiroketalisation step then furnishes the spiroketal moiety. Careful functional group
manipulations and key introduction of chirality were pivotal in the successful synthesis of a series of
coupling partners which allowed the successful synthesis of a series of tricyclic analogues of berkelic
acid as well as the entire tetracyclic core, with and without full substitution on the aromatic ring. The
formal total synthesis of berkelic acid faltered at the penultimate step, but this project has none the
less established a sound approach to this molecule which will build the foundations for a future total
synthesis.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Margaret Brimble</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-12-02T00:24:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-12-02T00:24:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6086</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2069453</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Compounds produced in these studies were submitted to a number of biological assays.
The marine alkaloid ascididemin has considerable activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis but unfortunately possesses significant cytotoxity and poor solubility. Analogues of ascididemin were prepared with variations at the 6-position and, in many instances, with replacement of the nitrogen at the 8-position with a carbon. Substituents were introduced that explored steric bulk and also enhanced aqueous solubility. Two new general routes were developed for the preparation of amide analogues at the 6-position of ascididemin. A set of 6-amidostyryl-8-deaza-ascididemin analogues showed considerable activity (MIC MTb 0.2-0.7 M), good solubility and modest to good selectivity (SIs from 6 to 125).
2-Pyranone natural products 1.14 and 1.15 have been reported to exhibit modest in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the related 2-pyranones pseudopyronines A (1.27) and B (1.28) and analogues are reported to have anti-parasitic activity. To explore the structure activity relationship of these compounds a library of 6-substituted-4-methoxy-2-pyranones was prepared. Significant in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum was observed for several members of the compound library (e.g. 3.55 and 3.61 with IC50 values of of 1.3 and 3.6 M, respectively). Biomimetic photo-dimerisation of several styryl pyrones was explored and isolated dimers submitted to assays. X-ray crystal structures of two of the monomers were used to rationalise the resulting dimer structures. These dimerised pyrones were found to be generally more active against P. falciparum and less toxic than their monomers and had the best selectivity of the pyrone library evaluated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Brent Copp</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010-12-17T01:53:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010-12-17T01:53:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6105</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2074100</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

As one of  the IPv4 - IPv6 coexistence techniques, an IPv4 - IPv6 translation will allow  any client connected to the IPv6-only network to communicate to an IPv4 host.  However the efficiency of any IPv4 - IPv6 translator has not been recognized  as an important metric to be considered even though most organizations that  will make use of an IPv4 - IPv6 translator should be interested in the best  translation technique based on its performance and stability. The purpose of  this study is to understand the fundamental structure and behavior of IPv4 - IPv6 translators and investigate the efficiency of currently implemented open  source IPv4 - IPv6 translation techniques. In this study, we have chosen two  IPv4 - IPv6 translators and a HTTP proxy to compare their efficiency based  on the Round-Trip time of packets against the native IPv4 and IPv6 connection.  The behavior of each packet translator and HTTP proxy is observed to  compare efficiency while it handles a variable number of simultaneous connections.  Through this study, we will understand how each translator and  HTTP proxy can be used to enable IPv4 - IPv6 communication and how efficient  these translation techniques are when it is deployed within a simple network.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Carpenter, Brian</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-03T20:42:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-03T20:42:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6345</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2122510</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Therefore, one of the objectives for scientists and engineers working in the energy industry is to create  new types of fuels which will be competitive with fossil fuels and which are economically profitable,  less harmful for environment and easy to produce.  Over the last decade bioethanol has established a reputation as a good potential substitute for  some products from oil and gas industries. Today some countries effectively use bioethanol as a  gasoline additive or an independent fuel for internal combustion engines. However, to use bioethanol  as a fuel it is required to purify the alcohol to a high degree. Thus, in our research we are studying the  separation of bioethanol from aqueous mixtures.  It is well known that ethanol and water make an azeotrope at 96.6 wt % of ethanol. To separate  this azeotropic mixture we proposed a membrane pervaporation process, which, compared to other  types of separation, is harmless to the environment and reduces energy consumption.  Although the membrane pervaporation processing is a fast-developing scientific field, there is  no information in the open literature about the design of the rig and simulation of the process is not  fully developed. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the efficiency of the membrane  process by building a lab-scale experimental rig and developing a computer simulation 'User module'  to model this process.  The experimental lab scale rig shows the practical efficiency of separation by using a  commercial HEGGEMANN membrane for pervaporation, while the 'User module, which was  developed in a VBA/Excel and can be a useful tool for process design. However, the lab scale rig  could not separate ethanol/water mixture under chosen condition. Therefore, two different ways to  solve this problem were suggested in this thesis. The first is to change a membrane and the second is to  transform the rig from pervaporation into vapour permeation.

Chapter 1 introduces the dipyrrins with an overview of the history of dipyrrin synthesis and the successful modern methods that have made dipyrrins more accessible to synthetic researchers. The remainder of the chapter covers a variety of dipyrrin compounds and their applications that have been reported in the literature. Chapter 2 describes the target dipyrrins and discusses the difficulties that were encountered firstly in synthesising their dipyrromethane precursors and then secondly with the dipyrromethane oxidation. Ultimately, both dipyrrins were successfully synthesised and characterised by NMR. Chapter 3 outlines the syntheses that were conducted using different boron halide reagents and attempts to complex one of the dipyrrins with cobalt (III). Substitution reactions were also attempted with various alcohols and the results discussed. Characterisation is provided for each compound that was successfully isolated. Chapter 4 covers conclusions that can be drawn from the research and possible future directions for this area of research. Chapter 5 details both the materials and equipment used in the course of this research as well as full details of the synthetic procedures that resulted in isolation of a characterised compound.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Brothers, Penny</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-24T20:40:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-24T20:40:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6438</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2175140</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: the author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The majority of the deaths recorded for 2008 occurred in the African region mainly due to non-compliance to the World Health Organisation's guidelines for the treatment and prevention of the disease. WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as using combination therapy is expected to delay the development of parasite resistance to the drugs. Artemisinin resistant strains of the Plasmodium parasite have already emerged in the South-East Asian region. Because of the parasites ability to relatively rapidly develop resistance to the existing treatment, new drugs are needed to be used as either monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. The aim of this particular project was to synthesise a series of amino acid derived β- carboline alkaloids that have antimalarial properties. The accent has been put on synthesising chiral compounds from optically pure amino acid starting materials since previous research has identifed that stereochemistry at the C-10 carbon of β-carboline alkaloids is important for antimalarial activity. Another feature that was observed to be improving the antiplasmodial activity of this class of compounds, the presence of the dimethylated amino group attached to C-10, has also been incorporated into the targets of this thesis. The (10S) and (10R) stereoisomers of both 10-dimethylphenylalanine and 10- dimethylleucine-β-carboline alkaloids were successfully synthesised. An attempt to synthesise 10-dimethyllysine-β-carboline analogues was however not completed due to time constraints. Biological evaluation of (10S)-dimethylphenylalanine-β-carboline and its synthetic precursors, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline intermediates, as well as the tetrahydro intermediates of the (R) stereoisomer established all analogues to be active in inhibiting the Plasmodium parasite. It was observed that the aromaticity of the β-carboline moiety is essential for improving both activity and selectivity of the compounds towards the parasite. Antimalarial activity for (10S)- dimethylphenylalanine-β-carboline was observed to be even better than the inhibitory activity of chloroquine making this compound a suitable candidate for in vivo testing.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Copp, Brent</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-24T23:34:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-24T23:34:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6443</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2171450</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: the author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Hydrochory, or seed dispersal by water, may have a significant influence on the structure of riparian vegetation and seed banks, however little is understood of these processes. This study examines the connections between hydrochory, geomorphology and flow regime in a small stream in the Waitakere Ranges, west Auckland, as a step towards an ecosystem based approach to riparian rehabilitation. Seed simulation experiments and soil seed bank analyses were used to assess seed transport, deposition and propagation across different geomorphic units in a representative reach in Glen Esk stream. Deposited seeds were located, counted and mapped in terms of their geomorphic position. The experiment was repeated 5 times in different flow. Soil seed bank samples were collected across gravel bars, benches, banks and floodplains, and germinated for identification. Soil characteristics and inundation frequency of different geomorphic units were analysed to examine potential for plant growth. Seeds deposited in areas of high geomorphic diversity, supporting the need to consider diverse geomorphic structure to promote seed deposition. Deposition patterns were most evident at the hydraulic unit scale. As expected, seeds deposited in low flow units (&lt; 0.05 ms- 1) along channel margins and were transported in higher flow units (&gt; 0.05 ms-1), such as runs and riffles. Seed deposition was greatest during base flow conditions; a range of 263 - 895 seeds were deposited in flows between 0.04 m3s-1 - 0.11 m3s-1, compared with 3 seeds deposited in flows of 1 m3s-1, suggesting that low flows are important for seed deposition in small streams. Deposition sites were poorly suited to plant growth with poor soil and disturbance characteristics however site suitability is prone to change. The results have important implications for rehabilitation of impacted streams that are often characterised by low flows, disconnected floodplains and high sediment loads. Incorporation of these processes in current management will ensure more effective rehabilitation results.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Dr. Sam Trowsdale</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-25T00:08:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-25T00:08:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6449</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2154779</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

A low-power  miniature thermoelectric controlled crystal oscillator (TECXO) has been designed,  manufactured, controlled and qualified for the first time. The TECXO employs a thin-film  thermoelectric device to either remove heat from or add heat to a crystal oscillator in  order to tightly control the temperature, and by consequence, the output frequency of the  crystal oscillator.  A dedicated off-board control and measurement system has been developed for the  TECXO, and a proportional-integral controller has been implemented on this system to  regulate the internal temperature of the TECXO. A tuning method for this controller has  been developed to provide a balance between warm-up time, steady-state stability and  ambient temperature change rejection. A novel non-linear compensation algorithm for  thermoelectric modules has been proposed and validated as part of the temperature  control system, providing a significant improvement to control performance. The  temperature controller has been demonstrated to provide temperature stability of ±0.05°C  under ramp ambient temperature conditions up to 2°C/min, warm-up time of less than  20s, and regulation of the TECXO's internal temperature up to 30°C below ambient.  A novel temperature compensation process has been proposed and validated as improving  the frequency stability of the prototype TECXO from ±151ppb to ±13.7ppb over a  temperature range of -20 to 70°C. This process significantly reduces the negative effect of  static thermal gradients within the TECXO on frequency stability over temperature.  The performance of the TECXO has been qualified: power consumption is 76mW at an  ambient temperature of 25°C and 2.7mW at an ambient temperature of 50°C, frequency  stability is better than ±10ppb over an ambient temperature range of 0 to 85°C, the short term  noise floor is 0.15ppb at a measurement time of 10s, and the frequency warm-up  time is less than 20s following power-on. As a result of the qualification process and  comparison to existing crystal oscillator products, the TECXO has been shown to provide  dramatic performance advantage in power consumption, ambient operating temperature  range and warm-up time over traditional temperature controlled crystal oscillators.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Xie, Shane Q.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-26T22:20:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-26T22:20:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6476</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2220961</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

are expressed in all cell types of the brain. During brain development, connexins have been
shown to play a key role in neuronal migration, neuronal cell differentiation and neurite
outgrowth. However, it is not well understood whether they are involved in adult neurogenesis.
In the adult mammalian brain, neural progenitor cells migrate from the subventricular zone
(SVZ) through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) along a glial tube, into the olfactory bulb
(OB) where they differentiate to produce new neurons. Cells from the SVZ have also been
demonstrated to proliferate and migrate to areas of cell loss in a wide range of neurological
disorders and brain injuries where they generate new neurons.
The present study aimed to characterize the expression of Cx30 and Cx43 in a QA-lesioned and
unlesioned SVZ/RMS of adult mammalian brain. Immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy
and SVZ explants were utilized to visualize and understand the roles that connexins play in the
migration process. It was found that in the SVZ/RMS of an adult, Cx30 is expressed in both the
major cells types of the SVZ/RMS, i.e., in neuroblasts and astrocytes. Cx43 was expressed in the
astrocytes with very little expression on the neuroblasts. The expression of both connexin
isoforms were region-dependent in both lesioned and unlesioned brains. Cx30 showed a
maximum association with neuroblasts in the anterior RMS, while astrocytes showed the highest
association in the SVZ. In the SVZ of a lesioned brain, the expression of both connexin isoforms
was increased in the neuroblasts. There was an increase in Cx43 in the astrocytes on the lesioned
side, while Cx30 was decreased in these cells. Cx43 showed the highest association with the
neuroblasts and astrocytes in the SVZ. In the explant cultures, there was no/very little
proliferation when the explants were treated with gap junctional blockers. It can be concluded
that connexins are expressed in the two most abundant cell types of the SVZ/RMS and their
presence is vital for the migration process to occur.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>O’Carroll, S</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Connor, B</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Nicholson, L</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-27T22:49:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-27T22:49:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6497</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2163497</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Traits that are identified for being a good biofuel plant also resemble the traits of becoming invasive. Salix viminalis or basket willow has long been used for basket weaving and is now being looked at for biofuel. The goal of this study is to investigate whether an increase of propagule pressure of S. viminalis as a biofuel crop could enhance the chance of it becoming invasive in New Zealand. BIOCLIM built within DIVA-GIS 7.1.7.2 was the ecological niche model used to investigate whether New Zealand is climatically suitability for S. viminalis. A total of 8360 georeferenced locations was used and they form the backbone of this study. Data sensitivities was observed in BIOCLIM as different predictions were observed under different georeferenced location. Low suitability was predicted in New Zealand for S. viminalis under the overall, introduced and Outliers analysis. In contrast, not suitable was predicted under the native and Northern Hemisphere analysis. The Southern Hemisphere and New Zealand only analyses were predicted from georeferenced location in the marginal bioclimate. However, the analyses showed different levels of suitability and is useful in further identify risk areas for S. viminalis. Growing degree days (GDD) was used to identify georeferenced locations that suits the growing conditions of the S. viminalis, which it simulates the occurrence of natural reproduction and as an increase of propagule pressure. Low suitability in New Zealand was predicted for the 5° C condition and not suitable for the 10° C condition. Therefore, It is unlikely that S. viminalis could overgrown and spread even if the growing condition was suitable. The GDD analysis with assumed georeferenced location produced more detailed maps with areas predicted similar to the normal GDD analyses. Although the chance of incursion of S. viminalis is low, the overall conclusion suggested areas most likely for incursions to occur are in Waikato, Manawatu and northern Nelson. The climate change analyses predicted a low suitability and a southern shift of niche for S. viminalis in New Zealand. In contrast, the GDD climate change analyses predicted a southern extension of suitable growing condition of S. viminalis in New Zealand. There is a also a decrease in area of excellent suitability. However, the occupy range of S. viminalis remain relatively unchanged. This highlighted the huge potential of adaptability in S. viminalis. Although the chance of incursion of S. viminalis due to climate change is also low, areas most likely for incursions to occur are in Christchurch/Canterbury regions.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Mitchell, N</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-02-28T23:12:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-02-28T23:12:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6525</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2150784</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: the author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Three personalitybased  profile types were identified: a detached and socially isolated type (n=97), an antisocial,  offending supportive type (n=73) and a third type with few clinically elevated personality  characteristics (n=128). Further analyses resulted in significant differences among the  personality-based profiles on the MACI subscales that measured response styles, adolescents‟  concerns and clinical problems. Offender, offence, and victim characteristics were recorded  from a retrospective file review. The results of this study provide support for high rates of  previous victimisation, family dysfunction, social isolation, substance abuse, and engagement  in other types of offending in male adolescent sex offenders. Furthermore, this study supports  the heterogeneity of male adolescent sex offenders on personality-based and psychopathology  characteristics. Although there were some emerging relationships of victim selection with the  personality-based profile types, none of the analyses reached statistical significance.  Furthermore, few meaningful statistically significant relationships with the profile types and  offender or offence characteristics were found. This may be due to the nature of the adolescent  developmental stage, whereby behaviour is fluid and persistent patterns are yet to be fully  established. Alternatively, relationships of offender, offence, and victim characteristics with  personality-based profiles may not exist, or are difficult to tease apart. The current research is  discussed regarding personality-based interventions. The study‟s strengths and limitations is  also discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Lambie, I</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>McDowell, H</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-01T02:15:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-01T02:15:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6538</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2110340</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The open nature of the system means that loss of photons  through the cavity mirrors as well as through spontaneous emission is allowed for. A variety  of interesting quantum{optical phenomena have already been found to occur in this system.  Specifically, behaviour indicative of a multiphoton blockade has been observed, and the system  undergoes a transition from strongly bunched to antibunched light production as the drive  strength is increased.  In this thesis, we examine the possibility of finding squeezed light in the cavity output field,  through numerical simulations and an analytic model of the system. For this purpose, calculations  exploring squeezing of the cavity internal mode in the system steady{state are  performed, and the squeezing spectrum of the cavity output field is computed.  In addition to the two{photon resonance, the Jaynes-Cummings model with the atom, cavity  mode and external drive all resonant is considered. The quasienergies and quasienergy states  for this system are known, and exhibit interesting behaviour with regards to squeezing as  a certain critical point in the drive strength is approached. We explore the possibility of  performing an adiabatic following of the system ground state in order to obtain squeezing of  the cavity internal mode, both in the presence and absence of damping.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Carmichael, H</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Parkins, S</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Collett, M</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-01T22:37:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-01T22:37:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6558</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2161665</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Pakistan was coerced by Washington to join the  US effort to dismantle the Taliban-Al Qaeda terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan and  Pakistan. While Pakistan's cooperation was deemed crucial for the success of the US  counter-terrorism strategy in Afghanistan, the US appears to be increasingly apprehensive of  Pakistan's policy. It is believed that Pakistan has employed a selective approach. It has  targeted Al Qaeda and other militants but has remained reluctant to target the Afghan  Taliban. The underlying reason for this inconsistent behaviour can be located in Pakistan's  conflicting interests in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan. Faced with domestic  economic problems and due to its regional and international compulsions, Pakistan  announced that it would join the US-led coalition in the war against terrorism in  Afghanistan. By joining the war, Pakistan gained economic benefits, improved its  international standing, and also denied India, an arch foe, an opportunity to use US  engagement in the area against it. On the other hand, the removal of the Taliban regime after  9/11 deprived Pakistan of a pro-Pakistan regime in Afghanistan. Moreover, the emergence of  an anti-Pakistan regime and the increasing involvement of India in Afghanistan added to  Pakistan's insecurities and Islamabad felt encircled from both eastern and western fronts.  Pakistan thus has been reluctant to fight against the Afghan Taliban.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Dr. Jian Yang</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-01T22:54:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-01T22:54:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6559</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2247982</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

making it the second highest in the Asia Pacific region (WHO, 2009). Most of the deaths are
from the rural areas. While the medical causes of maternal deaths are well known in PNG, very
few studies have been undertaken to understand the nonmedical factors which contribute to
maternal deaths in rural areas. The study used a qualitative exploratory approach to explore what
health professionals and women thought about the causes of maternal deaths and the possible
development of a Maternal Waiting House (MWH), and other similar initiatives to improve
maternal health outcomes in PNG.
The study reveals that in rural areas of Central Province there are many socio-economic, cultural,
and environmental constraints as well as health service related problems which prevent women
accessing essential obstetric care and contributing to the high maternal mortality rate. Key
factors identified included; poverty, scarcity of transport, negative cultural practices pertaining to
women, lack of awareness of the risk factors, and the geographical isolation of communities. In
addition, health service problems such as the shortage of skilled care providers, deteriorating
health facilities and poor outreach programmes are some of the factors which affect the quality
of obstetric care provided and prevent the use of maternal health services.
The study supports the growing opinion that reaching a health facility in time is the best strategy
for reducing maternal deaths. The establishment of a MWH may be an important way to bring
women close to health facilities to access timely health care. The study found that in Central
Province the MWH is a great need for rural women with problems of geographical access.
However, the MWH can only be effective if established and nestled within a functioning health
system that provides adequate obstetric services ready to receive women with complications. The
evidence from this study reveals that the current problems related with the health services and
the health system significantly underscores the value of developing an MWH. Addressing the
underlying social determinants, improvements to maternal health services, and strengthening of
the district health system are priorities for reducing maternal deaths.</dc:description><dc:contributor>McCool, J</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-02T02:45:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-02T02:45:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6563</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2170637</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: the author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

employees who were new to their roles either through organisational entry, promotion or re-assignment. In
addition, this study investigated whether increases in feedback-seeking over time for newcomers as a total group
would influence proximal and distal indicators of newcomer adjustment. In particular, this study examined
whether increases in feedback-seeking would positively predict newcomer learning across four domains and
negatively predict intent to quit. Lastly, this study explored the potential moderator role of self-efficacy on the
relationship between feedback-seeking and learning. 100 newcomers from a range of public and private
organisations within New Zealand, with approximately 4 weeks tenure, completed a 9 week longitudinal quasiexperiment.
Newcomers were assigned to either a training group or a no-training control group. All newcomers
completed three online questionnaires at 4 weekly intervals to measure feedback-seeking levels, adjustment
indicators, and self-efficacy over time. Questionnaire one was administered to all newcomers upon beginning
the study. The training group then received feedback-seeking training for three weeks. A training exercise was
emailed each week aimed at increasing feedback-seeking behaviour. Post-training, questionnaire two was
administered to all newcomers and all study variables were measured to evaluate change. Four weeks later a
final follow-up questionnaire was administered. Results are as follows: Controlling for pre-training differences
in feedback-seeking, the training group showed significantly higher levels of feedback-seeking post-training
compared to the no-training control group. Within-groups assessment showed the training group significantly
increased feedback-seeking levels over time whereas the no-training control group showed no significant change
in feedback-seeking over time. For the newcomers as one group, increases in feedback-seeking over time
positively predicted social learning, interpersonal resources learning, role learning, and organisational learning
and negatively predicted lower intent to quit. Self-efficacy was found to moderate the relationship between
feedback-seeking and organisational learning for newcomers low in self-efficacy. The implications of these
findings for organisational socialisation theory and intervention-based research and practice are discussed.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Cooper-Thomas, H</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-02T02:59:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-02T02:59:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6564</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2272938</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

In order to achieve this, I first examine the literature surrounding Social Security design and highlight the elements of economic theory which explain how PAYG social security system affects economic growth and how its effects might differ from that of a fully funded social security system. I proceed by constructing an ‘overlapping generations’ model (OLG) of New Zealand’s economy and then examine how the presence of the PAYG Social Security system can affect New Zealand’s long term economic growth and population. One of the more interesting features of New Zealand’s PAYG Social Security system is the fact that the benefits received by the retired individuals are paid out of general tax revenue, instead of being financed via a social security tax. This feature makes New Zealand’s Social Security system significantly different from the PAYG systems described in the literature and I attempt to explore this difference and its impact on New Zealand. The thesis concludes with a general discussion of the results of the analysis conducted and suggests a direction for future research.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Bandyopadhyay, Debasis</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-02T22:11:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-02T22:11:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6577</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2202344</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Although a number of mechanisms have been proffered by which mitochondrial supply of ATP can change to match varying workload in the myocardium, identifying the underlying regulatory pathways remains controversial. In this study, we have developed mathematical models of the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) pump and the acto-myosin cross-bridge cycle which, along with the Na+/K+ pump, are the key energy-consuming processes in the cardiomyocyte. These models encapsulate both thermodynamic considerations and metabolite sensitivity into a cycle-based framework. The parameters of these models are constrained by experimental data which characterise their physiological behaviour. These models are then placed within the context of a whole-cell electrophysiological framework, alongside a model of mitochondrial energy supply, to investigate the mechanisms that regulate energy control and to shed light on two experimental observations which, for many decades, have evaded a mechanistic explanation: the apparent linearity of the VO₂- PVA (pressure-volume area) relationship and the metabolic stability hypothesis, wherein demand-supply homeostasis is maintained despite negligible variation in metabolite concentrations at varying workloads. The predictions from our model simulations indicate that, under constant metabolite concentrations, the ATP-FTI (force-time integral) relationship is linear, while the ATP- FLA (force-length-area, cellular equivalent of VO₂- PVA) relationship is linear only at low work rates. The linearity of the ATP-FTI relationship is found to arise from kinetic properties of the cross-bridge model. This property is not retained in the ATP-FLA relationship and is lost when metabolite concentrations are allowed to vary, as during normal variation with changing workload. This suggests that FTI and FLA are not equivalent, and that the VO₂- PVA relationship may only be approximately linear. Finally, we show that metabolite concentrations change significantly with increasing workload if Pi feedback onto mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is removed from the model, suggesting that Pi-regulation alone is sufficient to maintain metabolic homeostasis in the absence of other regulatory mechanisms.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Crampin, Edmund J.</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Loiselle, Denis S.</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Smith, Nicolas P.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-02T22:26:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-02T22:26:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6579</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2088649</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: the author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

When united with social psychology's assertion that nonverbal cues, including facial expressions and voice tone, facilitate effective communication within social relationships, it suggests that these impairments impact negatively on quality of life for individuals with PD. This thesis aimed to investigate emotional processing deficits in PD, systematically, and their possible affect on social relationships. Thirty PD and 30 closely-matched control participants participated in three studies. Study 1 found that raters were less able to recognise emotional expressions from facial expressions and affective prosody in the PD group than the Control group. Study 2, using the Aprosodia Battery (Ross et al., 1997), found PD participants were impaired at recognition of affective prosody. A novel task was developed to assess recognition of facial expressions, comprising prototypical facial expressions and more subtle facial expressions. The PD group was impaired at recognition of subtle facial expressions but not prototypical facial expressions. Positive associations were found between performance on some recognition and production tasks in the PD group, providing support for an overall impairment in emotional processing in PD. When the PD group was subdivided based on side of symptom-onset, the group who developed right-sided symptoms first were more impaired compared to the Control group, than those who had left-sided onset of symptoms, suggesting a possible left-hemispheric lateralisation of emotional processing. Study 3, using a semi-structured interview, found that individuals with PD were less satisfied with their relationships with close others and acquaintances than the Control group, and that this was associated with how well the PD participants felt that others understood their facial expressions and affective prosody. Findings support the contribution of the basal ganglia to emotional processing, possibly as part of the thalamo-cortical loops, specifically, the skeleto-motor circuit, the lateral orbitofrontal circuit and the anterior cingulate circuit.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Tippett, Lynette</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-03T01:18:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-03T01:18:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6582</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2110547</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to clone the cDNA of two novel zebrafish genes,  identified by differential microarray expression analysis, irg1 (ENSDART00000101982) and  irg1-like (NM_001077607). The open reading frame of irg1 consists of 1161 basepairs, while  the irg1-like open reading frame is 1961 basepairs long. The deduced amino acid sequence  of each gene contained a single PrpD methylcitrate dehydratase domain which is highly  conserved, implying an important function.  We then used quantitative-PCR to verify the upregulation of these genes following bacterial  infection with Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, confirming that these immune  responsive genes are highly inducible by bacterial infection as detailed in the literature.  Whole mount in situ hybridisation was used to characterise the expression of irg1 following  hindbrain or yolk bacterial infection. Rapid (1 hour post infection) induction of irg1 expression  was observed both in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros, a known haematopoietic region, and at  the infection site. Over time the number of irg1-expresing cells in the aorta-gonadmesonephros  decreased, and infection site expression became restricted to discrete regions  of intense expression that persisted until at least 3 days post infection. The immune  responsive migratory character of these irg1-expressing cells suggests they are  macrophages. No irg1 expression was observed in control phosphate buffered saline  injected larvae or in a tail wounding assay, demonstrating that irg1 expression is induced by  bacterial infection, but not by sterile inflammation.  We also investigated the requirement for irg1 and irg1-like during infection. Splice blocking  morpholino oligonucleotide injection induced production of a truncated altered splicing  product, and was sufficient to decrease survival rates in infected morphant larvae, implying  that both irg1 and irg1-like are required to mount an appropriate innate immune response to  bacterial infection.  This study reports the first spatio-temporal characterisation of these two novel immune  responsive genes in a whole animal vertebrate model of infection, and provides evidence  which suggests irg1 is expressed by macrophages following infection, and that both irg1 and  irg1-like are required during the innate immune response to bacterial infection.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Hall, Chris</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-04T00:11:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-04T00:11:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-04</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6585</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2150306</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

account for intangibles, managers can voluntarily provide information about them.
Based on a sample of companies from East Asia, this thesis investigates the role of
voluntary non-financial disclosure about intangibles in a valuation context. Given the
proprietary nature of intangibles, the value of the information may not be perceived to
be useful by investors.
First, this thesis examines the relationship between voluntary disclosure of
intangibles and market value. Consistent with the capital market incentives argument,
the evidence shows that voluntary disclosure of intangibles contains value relevant
information. Second, this thesis investigates the effect of managerial ownership on the
value relevance of voluntary disclosure of intangibles. The results show that the value
relevance of intangibles is lower in companies with high managerial ownership,
supporting the view that high managerial ownership is associated with greater levels
of entrenchment. Third, this thesis analyzes the effect of institutional environments on
the disclosure of information about intangibles and the subsequent valuation of that
information. At comparable levels of managerial ownership, the value relevance of
intangibles is greater for companies in countries that have strong institutional
environments. This evidence is consistent with strong legal institutions having a
positive effect on financial reporting and corporate valuation.
Overall, the findings suggest that a strategy of voluntary disclosure could be
beneficial in resolving information asymmetry surrounding intangibles. In addition,
the effectiveness of voluntary disclosure of intangibles is conditional on the internal
corporate governance infrastructure and the external legal environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Cahan, Steven</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Emanuel, David</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-29T21:40:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-29T21:40:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6638</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2123921</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

hypothesised to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no
cure for T1D and treatments involve daily insulin injections with frequent monitoring of blood
sugar levels.
Regenerative medicine heralds a promising new era in medicine where organs ravaged by
trauma and disease might be repaired using stem cells acquired from the patient’s own body.
Adult stem cells transdifferentiated to produce insulin represent a potential source of
transplantable cells to treat T1D. One particular recent publication by Zhao et al. (2007)
reported that there were stem-like cells within human peripheral blood that have the ability to
express insulin. These cells uniquely attach to positively charged hydrophobic plates, and
amazingly start producing insulin on culture without forced differentiation. Similar studies have
reported that blood monocytes and mesenchymal stem cells can be differentiated into insulin
producing cells by culture with pancreatic factors and other differentiating agents
The aim of this project was to determine whether human blood cells that attach to
positively charged hydrophobic plates actually do produce insulin on culture, and whether they
could be differentiated into cells that closely resemble β-cells. This study was not able to
replicate the results obtained by Zhao et al, but nevertheless protocols were developed by which
the cells could be differentiated to produce insulin. Culture of the adherent population of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in Stemline Hematopoietic stem cell expansion media
produced large multinucleated cells that expressed insulin and other pancreatic proteins
including Pdx-1 and Glut-2. The cells also show varying expression of the
macrophage/monocytic markers HLA-DR, CD-14 and CD68, suggesting they had not fully lost
their monocytic character. Expression of insulin appeared to be intracellular as documented by
confocal microscopy. The cells possessed dense granules, as observed by transmission electron
microscopy, which may represent insulin-containing secretory granules. Similar insulinproducing
cells could be derived from the blood of T1D patients. This study provides important
foundations for further research to be undertaken to determine whether the insulin-expressing
cells reported here represent a potential source of cells for restoring the insulin-producing
capacity of the pancreas in the treatment of T1D.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Krissansen, Geoff</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Reddy, Shiva</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-03-29T23:28:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-03-29T23:28:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6640</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2128417</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Emergence of the Internet as a tool for continuing medical education (CME) prompted  the study, which compared an Internet-based CME course, small–group education  sessions and a passive mail-out of national guidelines. These were “one-off”  educational interventions as is common in CME.  A single-blind stratified cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) design was used.  Sixty nine practices were randomised to one of the three implementation strategies. The  two active arms participated in almost identical education sessions based on four  recommendations of the 2001 New Zealand Heart Foundation HF guideline. These  recommendations were selected as primary study outcomes because their performance  was suboptimal. Two of the recommendations – use of echocardiography and use of  high dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) – were not new in HF  management. Introduction of β-blockers to the treatment schedule illustrated a dramatic  change in accepted treatment. The indication for reintroducing spironolactone for HF  had changed.  Patients were identified using a HF scoring system. Twenty four practices completed  the study and 359 patients participated. Retrospective data were collected from the  patient cohort for up to five years.  Most echocardiograms were performed before the educational intervention. In each  group, ACEi prescription decreased over time, β-blocker use increased and  spironolactone use remained static. None of the three implementation strategies had a  statistically significant effect on outcomes. Two patient variables that negatively  predicted echocardiography referral and prescribing were older age and female sex.  The increase in β-blocker prescribing was mainly attributed to initiations that occurred in secondary care before the educational intervention. The intervention arms did not  affect the dose prescribed. Older age was negatively associated with dose.  None of the implementation strategies was superior in promoting change in primary  care. Changes that occurred either were negative or could be attributed to factors  operating beyond the control of the study, not to education. Ongoing work is required  to develop interventions that will reduce barriers to changing HF management in  primary care.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Arroll, Bruce</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Buetow, Stephen</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-06T23:43:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-06T23:43:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6651</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2124976</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Mutual interrogation was  proposed by Alangui (2010) as a way of resolving issues of ideological colonialism  and knowledge decontextualisation in investigations of mathematical knowledge in  cultural practice. The process involves implementing a critical dialogue between  holders of a specific cultural knowledge domain and mathematicians in order to  investigate the interactions that occur between their knowledge systems, and to look  at how the diverse ways of thinking about quantities, relationships and space can help  broaden or transform our conception of mathematics.  The thesis describes an adaptation of the above methodology to a study of food cover  (tudung saji) weaving among the weavers of Malaysia. These conical-shaped covers  are woven using a specific technique called triaxial or hexagonal weave, where the  strands are interlaced in three directions. A three-phase dialogue between several  weavers and mathematicians was implemented, with the researcher playing the role of  the mediator. Ethnographic techniques of participant observation, audio and video  recording, field notes and interviews (both unstructured and semi-structured) were  employed to document the dialogue and explore weaving limitations and possibilities.  A computer-generated weaving template was also created to mediate investigations.  The interactions between the conventions of the weavers and the concepts of the  mathematicians uncovered differing perspectives on the construction of the tudung  saji and the use of the template. The research findings highlight the role of mutual  interrogation in establishing communication between the knowledge systems and the  practitioners. Furthermore, mutual interrogation both affected the contemporary  practices of the weavers and drew the mathematicians' attention to the way the  process of interpreting a cultural activity can lead to the invention of new  mathematical structures.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Barton, Bill</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Bartholomew, Hannah</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-08T00:38:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-08T00:38:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6654</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2124607</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

While most human joints move with a static rotational axis, the knee's axis o  rotation relocates during  flexion-extension movement  resulting in an overlap of rolling and gliding motion in the joint. Determining the  paths of motion and consequently the resulting pressures and contact forces in the  knee compartment due to tibiofemoral articulation during gait is extremely useful  for planning clinical procedures and in designing knee braces and implants. While  previous two-dimensional knee models based on four-bar-mechanisms have been  proven to be useful, but wrong due to neglecting several aspects of knee motion,  three -dimensional models have been developed in recent computer simulations.  These modelling works are often based on one individual data set and contain many  assumptions and constraints.  The research presented here is based on the four-bar-linkage (4BL) mechanism.  While the model is approached in two dimensions, it is later advanced to three  dimensions. The four links are representing the knee's cruciate ligaments as well  as the tibial and femoral condyle's surfaces. All the mechanism's links are at  first  considered as one-line rigid bars and in the model considered vectors. The three-  dimensional model includes the physiological orientation of the cruciate ligaments  and the screw-home mechanism. With the input variable being the flexion-extension  angle of the knee, the dynamic model will eventually also include the ligament  wrapping of the posterior cruciate ligament around the posterior edge of the tibial  condyle.  Showing in a quantitative and qualitative approach that the resulting motion of  the tibial condyle towards the femoral condyle does not coincide with the physiological shape of the condyles of the CMISS model, the necessity arises to include  non-rigid links. Eventually, the change of length of the ligaments depending on the  angle of  flexion and extension rounds the model o . To the author's knowledge, a  model which is based on a four-bar linkage, but includes three-dimensions as well as  significant mechanisms of the knee joint, such as screw-home, has until completion  of this thesis not been published.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Mithraratne, Kumar</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Hunter, Peter</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-15T04:58:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-15T04:58:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6661</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2230475</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Previous
studies from our group have suggested that A1 adenosine receptor agonists have great
potential to ameliorate noise-induced cochlear injury. Current study was undertaken to
determine if stimulating A3 adenosine receptors also mitigates hearing loss caused by
oxidative stress and promotes cochlear recovery from acoustic trauma.
Selective A3 adenosine receptor agonist Cl-IB-MECA (10μM), selective A3 receptor
antagonist MRS1191 (100μM) and a control vehicle (1% DMSO) solution have been applied
to the round window membrane of the rat cochlea 4-6 hours after exposure to 110dB sound
pressure level (SPL) half-octave band noise (8-12 kHz) for 24 hours. The auditory brainstem
responses (ABRs) measured 48 hours after drug administration demonstrated no recovery of
hearing thresholds in cochleae treated with Cl-IB-MECA or MRS1191. The generation of
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the cochleae exposed to noise was not altered by
administration of Cl-IB-MECA or MRS1191. Stimulating or inhibiting A3 receptor also
showed no effect on hair cell survival two days after noise exposure. However, the level of
apoptosis in noise exposed cochlea was significantly reduced by CL-IB-MECA. Surprisingly,
MRS1191 also reduced apoptosis, although to a lower extent. This suggests that the
inhibition of the A3 receptors activates other anti-apoptotic mechanisms, e.g. mediated by A1
adenosine receptors.
This study is, therefore, not conclusive regarding the role of A3 adenosine receptors in
cochlear protection from noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Possible long-term
consequences of A3 receptor activation on hearing thresholds and hair cell survival in the
noise-exposed cochlea require further investigation.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Vlajkovic, Srdjan</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-28T00:44:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-28T00:44:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6681</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2181278</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Neuroserpin is an inhibitor of the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and has been shown to have roles in neuroprotection and neurite outgrowth. The most well known function of tPA is to cleave plasminogen into plasmin. tPA is expressed in the Central Nervous System and is implicated in multiple processes including synaptic regulation, synaptic plasticity and neuronal injury. Activity-dependent of tPA and neuroserpin through the regulated secretory pathway is important in these processes. Preliminary data from the Birch laboratory suggested that tPA was involved in the sorting of neuroserpin in PC12 cells to a vesicle population characteristic of the regulated secretory pathway. Recent research from other laboratories had also showed that tPA can modulate calcium levels in neuronal cells through interactions with the NMDA receptor. The goal of this research project was to further probe the importance of interactions between tPA and neuroserpin for neuroserpin sorting and tPA function. Fluorescent chimeras of tPA and neuroserpin were used to probe a possible faciltatory role for tPA in the targeting of neuroserpin to vesicles that accumulated in neurite tips, a characteristic of the regulated secretory pathway in neuronal cells. Expression of tPA-GFP led to increased accumulation of a DsRed:neuroserpin chimera in the neurite tips of NGF-treated PC12 cells. Immunocytochemistry was used to show that the sorting of endogenous neuroserpin to the neurite tips of PC12 cells was also enhanced in the presence of tPA-GFP. To elucidate the mechanism behind the sorting effect of tPA-GFP on neuroserpin, neuroserpin mutants P1 and P14 were used. The results indicated that the P1 residue which is important for the initial interaction between tPA and neuroserpin is crucial for the targeting of neuroserpin to the neurite tips by tPA. The P14 neuroserpin mutant is reactive center loop mutant of neuroserpin and proved to be important for the sorting of neuroserpin by tPA. Taken together these results indicate that interaction between tPA and neuroserpin is necessary for the effect of tPA on neuroserpin sorting.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Birch, Nigel</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-29T00:25:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-29T00:25:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6687</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2147438</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Over the last twenty years TCP has become the dominant application layer  protocols and most Internet traffic is TCP traffic. More and more applications are now  migrating towards over TCP other than UDP. Therefore, it is important to understand  the long term trends and behaviors of TCP flows in order to better understand TCP  traffic.  One important objective of this project is to design, development and analyze TCP  traffic traces over different years and different organizations to investigate the long  term impacts of TCP flows in network traffic trace files by using four traditional  measurement metrics: the average packet length of TCP flows, the lifetime of TCP  flows, the packet count of TCP flows and the Round-Trip Time of TCP packets.  The second objective of this thesis is to observe different features of individual TCP  flows by passively extracting samples of long lifetime TCP flows from each traffic  trace files. We have observed that some TCP flows appear to have a regular pattern of  RTT and RTT Variation distribution. We have also noted that some long active TCP  flows with small volume transmitted have relatively fast response times.  Self-Similarity appears to exist in the RTT and RTT Variation distribution of  individual TCP flows, and TCP flows with long RTT might be result of various  factors.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Carpenter, Brian E.</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Brownlee, Nevil</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-05-03T03:51:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-05-03T03:51:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6699</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2161380</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

However, despite their importance, little is known about the mechanisms by which GnRH is produced. GnRH neurons exhibit complicated membrane potential dynamics, in the form of electrical bursting, and this bursting is closely coupled to the dynamics of intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺  ) in ways that are not yet well understood. A mathematical model has been constructed to help understand the mechanisms underlying the observed behaviours of GnRH neurons, and how electrical bursting synchronizes with transients in the cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]cyt). Simulations show that the model is consistent with all of the most important experimental data in- volving TTX (tetrodotoxin), zero extracellular-[ Ca²⁺] ([Ca²⁺]e) solution, apamin, CPA (cyclopiazonic acid) and 2-APB (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate). The mathematical model predicted the existence of particular [Ca²⁺]cyt-activated potassium (K⁺) channels (sIAHP-UCL), which were then confirmed experimentally. In contrast to the apamin-sensitive [Ca²⁺]cyt-activated K⁺  channels (sIAHP-SK), which control both the structure of firing within bursts and the interburst intervals, sIAHP-UCL solely determines the interburst dynamics. Furthermore, we show how a fast-slow bifurcation analysis of the model can be used to understand the behaviour of the cells under a wide range of experimental conditions. The high complexity of the initial GnRH neuron model prompted us to develop a much simpler bursting model based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model. This simplified bursting model exhibits the similar qualitative behaviour as our initial GnRH neuron model. The use of bifurcation analysis with the FHN model simplifies the simulation of bursting, and the results of this analysis are also briefly explained.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Sneyd, James</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-05-10T20:01:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-05-10T20:01:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6731</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2128989</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In  this study, 189 senior executives underwent a battery of psychometric, biographical and  performance measures. The dimensions of approach and avoidance motivation were  measured using Carver and White's (1994) 'BIS/BAS Scales', and the predictive power of  these dimensions was compared to R. Hogan and Hogan's (1997) ambition and adjustment  traits. Overall, a model of senior executive performance prediction was tested using  structural equation modelling. The results showed that the 'BIS/BAS Scales' did not predict  the selected aspects of executive performance. However, the Hogan ambition and adjustment  traits did, but only when certain facets of these traits were used. Most notably, the  executives' levels of experience and perceived reward at work were stronger predictors of  performance than personality was. The results suggest that reinforcement sensitivity theory  does not provide a particularly promising explanation for senior executive job performance,  with the chosen measures, but that selected Hogan measures do. However, executive  performance prediction is very much a nuanced phenomenon, and these nuances only emerge  when the performance and predictor domains are measured and analysed at a facet level.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Boxall, Peter F.</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Burch, Giles St. J.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-05-11T03:19:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-05-11T03:19:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6732</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2130915</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Religion is a major feature of Byron's poetry, both as a source of imagery and as a subject of commentary. In the early nineteenth century, readers could be expected to understand and to respond to a range of biblical references and theological concepts, and this thesis explores those representations. Ten of Byron's major poems are considered in detail here: Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Don Juan, The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos, The Corsair, Lara, The Siege of Corinth, Manfred, Cain, and Heaven and Earth. These are the works which focus most heavily upon religious topics, whereas other writings by the poet are discussed only where particularly relevant. While most of these ten concern Christianity, The Giaour, The Bride of Abydos, The Corsair, Lara, and The Siege of Corinth deal in more detail with Islam, and some other religious systems are occasionally mentioned. In the consideration of such representations of religion, crucial considerations are the characterization of God, the differences between depictions of the clergy and depictions of the laity, the respect afforded to sacred texts, and especially the comparison of orthodoxy ('correct opinion') with orthopraxy ('correct practice'). Many of these points vary considerably throughout the corpus of Byron's poetry, but certain consistencies are evident. One is the generally-respectful representation of the figure of God. Another is the frequent condemnation of heteropraxy and the careful avoidance of criticism of orthodoxy, even to the extent of criticizing heteropraxy from an orthodox viewpoint. A third is the resistance to dogmatism, coupled with a scepticism or even a hostility towards ecclesiastical authority. Throughout his work, then, the poet validates a devout but unconventional faith, one which failed to please his more conservative contemporaries but which was nonetheless far from the atheism with which he is often charged.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Wilkes, Joanne</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-05-26T00:02:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-05-26T00:02:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6763</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2134624</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Currently there is no treatment available.  Unilateral hypoxic-ischemia (HI) in the three day old rat is well established as a model  of brain injury in infants born at 22 to 26 gestational weeks. However, it is inherently  variable. I show that this injury results in short term neurological deficits which may be  capitalised upon for allocation of pups into treatment studies.  After it is injured, the brain tries to repair itself using processes that are a recapitulation  of those that occur during brain development. Using a model of injury to the immature  brain our laboratory has identified roles for the closely related anterior pituitary  hormones growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) in the brain after injury.  Though the role of GH in neuroprotection is well demonstrated, little is known of its  capacity for neuro-restoration subsequent to injury. I found that GH receptor  immunoreactivity is upregulated in the ipsilateral subventricular zone at five days after  injury, corresponding both spatially and temporally with injury-induced neurogenesis.  Cells immunopositive for the GH receptor included proliferating and neural precursor  cells and post-mitotic neuroblasts. Together with the finding from our laboratory that  GH stimulates proliferation of embryonic mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), these results  indicate a novel role for GH in injury-induced neurogenesis.  Whilst PRL is known to exert effects on neural progenitor and glial cells after injury to  the central nervous system, its role in development of extra-hypothalamic brain regions  has not been examined. Using a novel real time PCR assay I reveal the ontogeny of the  long, fully functional PRL receptor isoform in the rat cerebral cortex and find that it  parallels that of neurite initiation and outgrowth markers. Indeed, treatment of neurons  derived from adult mouse NSCs with PRL increased the number of primary and  secondary neurites. These results implicate a role for PRL in development of the  cerebral cortex.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Breier, Bernhard</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Fraser, Mhoyra</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-06-09T02:22:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-06-09T02:22:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6781</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2169736</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

Currently most research into XSQO concentrates on optimisation based on structural constraints in the XML documents. Research, which optimises XML query execution based on semantic constraints, has been limited because of the flexibility of XML. In this thesis, we introduce a method, which optimises XML query execution based on the constraints on the content of XML documents. In our method, elements are analysed and classified based on the distribution of values of sub-elements. Information about the classification is extracted and represented in OWL, which is stored in the database together with the XML document. The user input XML query is evaluated and transformed to a new query, which will execute faster and return exactly the same results, based on the element classification information. There are three kinds of transformation that may be carried out in our method: Elimination, which blocks the non-result queries, Reduction, which simplifies the query conditions by removing redundant conditions, and Introduction, which reduces the search area by introducing a new query condition. Two engines are designed and built for the research. The data analysis engine is designed to analyse the XML documents and classify the specified elements. The query transformation engine evaluates the input XML queries and carries out the query transformation automatically based on the classification information. A case study has been carried out with the data analysis engine and we carried out a series of experiments with the query transformation engine. The results show that: a. XML documents can be analysed and elements can be classified using our method, and the classification results satisfy the requirement of XML query transformation. b. content based XML query transformation can improve XML query execution performance by about 20% to 30%. In this thesis, we also introduce a data generator, which is designed and built to support the research. With this generator, users can build semantic information into the XML dataset with specified structure, size and selectivity. A case study with the generator shows that the generator satisfies the requirements of content-based XSQO research.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dobbie, Gillian C.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-06-15T22:53:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-06-15T22:53:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6815</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2149889</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

This qualitative study aims to investigate the process of inspiration from the Reggio Emilia approach and analyse the risks and possibilities associated within early childhood education. Six New Zealand early childhood teachers, working across a range of educational contexts, were interviewed for their interpretations of the impact and local relevance of this Italian pedagogy. Analysis revealed strong responses, a shared perspective on the issue of appropriation, commonalities between cultural contexts, and the complexities involved in constructing an identity as an early childhood setting in Aotearoa New Zealand. The teachers were found to contextualise the principles of the Reggio Emilia pedagogical approach to fit within their individualised contexts. They each make connections between the Italian and New Zealand pedagogies in an effort to interpret the commonalities and dissonances that exist. The teachers' meaning-making of the approach involves much dialogue where the theoretical principles are critiqued and debated in determining their appropriateness for Aotearoa New Zealand. This results in teachers reconstructing their pedagogy through making meaning of the principles of the Reggio Emilia pedagogical approach interwoven within the early childhood curriculum document Te Whāriki. This is embedded in this study's conclusion; that a meaningful pedagogy, reflective of its cultural context, can be achieved when teachers' contextualise the deeper philosophical underpinnings within their own individualised contexts. The process of pedagogical change investigated in this study holds implications for  researchers, policy makers, professional development organisations, early childhood employers and teachers.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Hill, Diti</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Sansom, Adrienne</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-06-26T22:26:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-06-26T22:26:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6844</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2198361</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

However,  the installations of long piping system, fittings and joints in traditional systems are causing  substantial refrigerant losses. The refrigerant losses in turn bring about cost and high environmental  damage in terms of ozone layer depletion and global warming potential. Additionally, defrosting of  air-coils is one of the most energy consuming processes in supermarket refrigeration systems due to  susceptibility of the air-coils to moisture. Hence, the frost forming on air-coils as a result of  moisture transfer should be removed to keep display cabinets under the required temperature.  Various studies, though limited in scope, have been conducted both numerically and experimentally  by several researchers in order to provide efficient and environmentally friendly supermarket  refrigeration technologies. Empirical and mathematical expressions have also been continuously  developed to quantify frost characteristics on flat plates and round tubes thereby determining the  appropriate defrost periods. Cascade and secondary coolant refrigeration systems are the potential  candidates to replace traditional ones due to the fact that the former can work on natural  refrigerants and the latter essentially eliminates long connecting lines and environmentally  damaging refrigerants. Development of empirical correlations for frost characteristics on real heat  exchangers could also provide accurate prediction of defrost periods thereby eliminating  unnecessary waste of energy and deterioration of food products.  The current study, therefore, presents (a) mathematical expressions for carbon dioxide-ammonia  (R744-R717) cascade refrigeration system; (b) mathematical expressions for frost property and air  pressure drop; and (c) a numerical model for medium-temperature secondary coolant system  incorporating the new frost property correlations. The thermodynamic analysis of the cascade  refrigeration system is useful for the supermarket refrigeration industry to optimize the design and  operating parameters of the system. The development of the frost property correlations from  experiments on a lab-scale flat-finned-tube heat exchanger is also useful for the supermarket  refrigeration industry for better prediction and control of defrost periods and duration for medium temperature  air-coils. The medium-temperature secondary coolant model adopted the most  appropriate heat transfer, mass transfer and pressure drop correlations obtained from the open  literature. The system components such as air-coil, plate heat exchangers, distribution lines, coolant  pump and compressor were modeled independently. Each component model was validated and  linked to form a complete overall medium-temperature secondary coolant refrigeration system  model.     The experimental results showed that COP of the Monopropylene glycol/water based medium temperature  secondary coolant refrigeration system could be 1.33, whereas the simulated results on  a typical supermarket showed that COP of the system could be as high as 1.75.  The fundamental difference between the existing secondary coolant models and the current one is  that frost characteristics have been incorporated in the air-coil model. In addition to this, complete  independent models have been developed for plate heat exchangers based on their respective  applications. Hence, the main advantage of the current medium-temperature secondary coolant  refrigeration system model is that defrost periods and time span required to defrost frosted air-coils  can be accurately determined to achieve energy savings and prevent product deterioration in the  display cabinets. The plate heat exchanger models can also enable one to reasonably determine  pressure drops thereby leading to an appropriate coolant pump selection.  Finally, a step-by-step exercise of the application of the secondary coolant model, which has been  included in this project, can be used to completely design, select, evaluate and install such systems  or retrofit the existing traditional direct expansion refrigeration systems in supermarkets.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted until Oct. 2013, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Bansal, Pradeep</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-06-27T20:46:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-06-27T20:46:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6846</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2163601</dc:relation><dc:rights>Whole document restricted until October 2013.

individual players in their respective roles, and the effectiveness of interactions between
players as they work together in the team. Information on the exact demands of a
player’s role and an effective and objective way to evaluate their performance will
provide insight into their tactical strengths and weaknesses.
A system for measuring and evaluating a netball player’s performance on court is
described, and statistical methods such as cluster analysis were used to firstly profile the
different playing positions, and then also to classify players within each position by their
strengths, weaknesses and tactical preferences. These results provide coaches with
another tool to use for selection and strategy decisions.
A comprehensive list of variables was developed in consultation with elite netball
coaches and players and data were sourced from television footage of the 2008 ANZ
Championship netball competition. Each of the seven playing positions was profiled
using simple exploratory analysis and then nine different clustering algorithms were
compared in their ability to correctly classify players into their correct positions. The
same algorithms were then used to identify 3-4 types of player within each position,
according to their tactical differences within the game.
Model-based clustering produced the most accurate partitioning of players into playing
positions, with an accuracy of 85%, followed by the e-distance and Ward’s methods on
78% each. At the other end of the scale was single linkage, with a best accuracy of just
38%. Kernel k-means, which was designed to be an improvement on ordinary k-means,
also performed poorly (59%). In the final stage of the project there were 3-4 player types
successfully identified within each position, providing insight into how different players
approach the game, and how to utilise their different strengths when planning game
strategy.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Lee, Alan</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Hume, Patria</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-07-03T21:47:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-03T21:47:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6862</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2164059</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

It considers some dominant discourses surrounding girlhood and sexuality and how they work to structure girls' lives, their understandings of sexuality and themselves as sexual subjects. Underpinned by a feminist post-structural framework, this study examines girls' complex engagements with the multiple contradictory discourses that give meaning to the sexual self. To consider the discursive construction of girls' sexual subjectivities, I draw upon the narratives of girls' aged 11-13 years, generated in both focus group and individual interviews. In addition, this research involves a visual research method to gather the girls' thoughts and ideas on sexuality. By prioritising girls' own conceptualisations, this research offers understandings of girls' sexual subjectivities that recognise their sexual agency. Research findings suggest girls constitute their sexual subjectivities in ways that draw upon and resist dominant discourses of girlhood and sexuality. The girls' narratives reveal how their understandings of themselves as sexual subjects sit in tension with many dominant discourses, in particular those that position girls as 'non-sexual' and 'vulnerable'. The findings also illustrate how many girls subvert, undermine and overtly challenge dominant heterosexualised discourses of femininity. Girls are seen to have agency to resist (to some extent) these dominant discourses and create other ways of understanding and expressing their sexuality. This research offers valuable insights into girls' sense of themselves as sexual beings. These understandings are crucial for the development of sexuality education programmes that are relevant to girls' lives and better meet their needs and interests. I argue for girls to be conceptualised not as vulnerable and passive victims, but as legitimate sexual beings who have the right to explore and express their sexuality in a variety of ways.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Allen, Louisa</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-07-19T20:29:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-19T20:29:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6966</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2188956</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

The first approach represents a theoretical one based one existing literature, discussing the three core concepts - place, identity and return migrating - independently while applying conclusions and findings to the current case study of Māori return migration. The second part of the study consists of a field study of eight actual returnees to a Northland community, one non-returnee and two potential returnees. Information about the two potential returnees is derived from published interviews while data from actual returnees and the non-returnee is gathered by semi-structured interviews. After applying Social Identity Theory, all data is analysed qualitatively and discussed in relation to conclusions derived from the theoretical analysis, and in relation to the international context of indigenism, the national context of the Māori renaissance and to the regional context of the Muriwhenua land claim. Confirming findings of literature about return migration returnees' characteristics vary, as do return motives which are usually deeply personal. Nevertheless, two clusters of return motives emerge amongst informants: family- and culturally related ones. Profiles of culturally motivated returnees are in line with those suggested in literature on Māori return migration of young urban individuals of Māori descent who are influenced by the current social and political context of the Māori renaissance and the propagated Māori prototype. The study provides a departure point for practical purposes such as rural and urban planning, while arguing the importance of individuals' identification practices for return decisions in light of anticipated increases of ethnification and indigenist movements. The interdisciplinary and contextual approach appears suitable for a holistic understanding of the complex phenomenon of return migration.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Yoon, Hong-key</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Vaughan, Graham</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-07-20T22:32:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-20T22:32:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6985</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2169798</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

In New Zealand, sensitive soils are derived from in situ weathering of fine-grain pyroclastic deposits; elsewhere they are typically deposits of glacial derived 'rock flour'. This research describes the nature of sensitive pyroclastic deposits and proposes a possible process to their formation. Investigations focused on the ~1 Ma Kidnappers tephra due to its widespread nature and typical exposure at the base of cliffs where it is typically saturated and contributes to landslides. Field observations found that these soils are generally syn-eruptively reworked pyroclastic deposits of variable grain-size and plasticity, with typical deposits being high to extremely high plasticity silts. These soils are often the basal shear plane of landslides in the Auckland and Tauranga regions. X-ray diffraction studies found a typical mineralogy of quartz and plagioclase together with the clay minerals halloysite and kaolinite. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed these soils have a quasi-matrix microstructure inherited from the original vesicular texture that has been modified by weathering into clay minerals without a significant change in porosity. Geotechnical testing determined the physical and material properties of the soils to be: dry density, 0.9 -- 1.1 g/cm3; moisture content, 49%  - 104% by mass; peak friction angle, 15° - 32°; peak cohesion, 10 -- 80 kPa; residual friction angle, 14° - 30°; residual cohesion, 0 -- 13 kPa; sensitivity, 6 to 24. Key factors in the genesis of sensitive pyroclastic deposits are: i.) an original low density deposit composed of vesicular glass and pumice fragments, ii.) weathering of primary material to form halloysite and kaolinite, iii.) a delicate microstructure dominated by clay mineral microaggregates in a high-porosity fabric, and iv.) high natural water content that promotes fluid behaviour during shearing. Of these four conditions original vesicular texture and weathering that promotes the formation of kaolin group minerals are the most important factors in the generation of sensitivity. The results of this research will help practitioners to recognize and respond to sensitive pyroclastic soils and contributes to the understanding of these soils in a global context.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Prebble, Warwick</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>St. George, John</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Locke, Corinne</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Wilson, Colin</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-07-20T22:50:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-20T22:50:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6986</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2161067</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

We take into account the full atomic level structure for this transition, including the Zeeman energy shift, as well as the atom's coupling to the two orthogonal modes of the cavity. We consider two different cases: one of the cavity modes is a) resonantly driven by a coherent field and b) driven by incoherent light; while light in the other cavity mode, in both cases, is generated only through spontaneous emission. For the coherent field case, we adopt a semiclassical treatment for the driven cavity mode and adiabatically eliminate the non-driven mode. A semiclassical treatment is not suitable for incoherent light, thus we adiabatically eliminate the driven and non-driven mode. Assuming that the atoms act as independent emitters, we are able to compute second-order correlation function for the non-driven mode from an atomic ensemble. We find that the system presents quantum beats and are visible only in the intensity autocorrelation function. The case for coherent driving exhibits two sources of oscillation, corresponding single atom beating of two ground states and two photons of different atoms. The incoherent case has only one source of beating corresponding to single atom beating of two ground states. The system shows a transition from antibunching to bunching as we increase the number of atoms in the cavity.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Carmichael, Howard J.</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-07-21T23:36:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-07-21T23:36:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6999</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2204776</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Much of the pathogenesis and mortality attributed to DM are due to the long-term complications of hyperglycaemia, which is characteristic of the disease. This thesis presents structural and functional studies of two previously uncharacterised human enzymes, dihydrodipicolinate synthase-like protein (DHDPSL) and D-xylulokinase (XK). Both enzymes were revealed to have unexplored associations with DM. DHDPSL is distantly related (~25% sequence identity) to a family of Schiff base-dependent aldolases that include dihydrodipicolinate synthase and N-acetylneuraminate lyase. Despite these distant homologies the biological function of DHDPSL is unknown. It also does not map to any known metabolic pathway in humans, but is targeted to the mitochondrial compartment consistent with the presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. There are also strong associations between mutations in the Dhdpsl gene and primary hyperoxaluria type III a rare disorder of endogenous oxalate production. The DHDPSL crystal structure was determined by X-ray crystallography utilising in situ proteolysis of a fusion of DHDPSL with maltose-binding protein for crystallisation. Two apoforms and six Schiff base complexes with potential ligands were analysed at best to 2.0 Å resolution and with an Rfree of 18.3%. DHDPSL is folded as (a/ss)₈-barrel with a C-terminal subdomain and forms a tetramer in the crystal. The structural consequences of the diseaserelevant DHDPSL mutations were analysed and were found to largely affect the C-terminal subdomain. Findings also showed that DHDPSL acts as an oxaloacetate decarboxylase and is therefore likely to be a bifunctional oxaloacetate decarboxylase /4-hydroxy-2-ketoglutarate aldolase present in the liver and kidney mitochondria. Overall, these results revealed the presence of a potentially significant metabolic pathway in mitochondria whereby oxaloacetate can be converted to pyruvate. XK has a potential role in the regulation of de novo lipogenesis in the liver that has gained little previous attention. Excessive hepatic lipid accumulation is linked to impaired insulin response and the development of DM. XK was identified and produced recombinantly in Eschericia coli aided by molecular chaperones. Crystals suitable for structural analysis were obtained after five generations of repeated seeding. Five crystal structures were used to analyse substrate binding, the best of which was determined at 2.0 Å resolution with an Rfree of 17.8%. XK assumes an actin-like two-domain FGGY sugar kinase fold. The most striking feature revealed by the XK molecular structure was a dramatic domain movement that must accompany catalysis. A competitive inhibitor of XK, 5-deoxy-5-fluoro-D-xylulose (Ki of 25.4 M) was also functionally validated and structurally analysed. A supplemental structural study of a major hypoxic response protein of unknown function, Rv1738, from the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is also described. This study presents the first novel protein structure to be determined by the racemic protein crystallography method. The Rv1738 structure exposes a relationship with a family of ribosome-inhibiting stress-response proteins that may be indicative of its function.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Baker, Ted</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Loomes, Kerry</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-02T22:41:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-02T22:41:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7142</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2159860</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

effects of these changes in connexion expression in the disease process are therefore important. The
need to screen for connexin expression quickly and cost-effectively has directed attention to microarray
technology. The aim of the first section of this study was to design a „boutique‟ microarray chip to
screen for mRNA for all the reported connexins in the human. Where possible, the probes were
designed to be compatible with the rat connexin mRNA. Twenty 50-base length oligonucleotide
custom-designed probes, fourteen of them showing cross-species human/rat alignment, and twenty
probes for the human connexin sequences designed by the German company MWG were included in
the array. The array was tested on rat and on human tissue and the result validated by the Affymetrix
GeneChips. Results confirmed that our array design was reliable, had a consistent target binding pattern
and that it could detect differential connexin gene expression in both human and rat tissues.
As our goal was to screen human brain tissue for connexin expression, obtaining RNA of
sufficiently high quality to be used in microarray experiments became a concern. We investigated
whether it was possible to obtain high quality RNA from postmortem human tissue using samples
obtained from the New Zealand Neurological Foundation Human Brain Bank. The principle finding
was that RNA quality is most strongly affected by the pH of the tissue, with both the pH and the RNA
quality being influenced by the mode of death. The best quality RNA samples were then used for the
screening of human brain tissue for connexin expression.
One control and five disease samples from the secondarily affected regions of Huntington‟s (MC),
Parkinson‟s (CN) and Alzheimer‟s disease, as well as hippocampus samples from two mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy patients were screened on the custom-designed connexin array and on the Illumina
Sentrix arrays to search for changes in the expression of connexins and inflammatory cytokines. It
proved possible to obtain consistent data from the two platforms from samples with a wide range of
RNA quality, and certain common patterns in the change of connexins and inflammatory markers were
identified.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Nicholson, Louise</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Green, Colin</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-03T23:31:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T23:31:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7151</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2171061</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

gene transcription, DNA damage repair and DNA replication. Histone acetylation
homeostasis is maintained by a balance in the activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC) and
acetyltransferases. Disruption in their activity can lead to malfunctioning cells, cell death
and disease. There is increasing evidence suggesting that deregulation of histone acetylation
and consequential effects leading to aberrant gene expression may influence
neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. To date, rodent models of Huntington’s disease
(HD) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have generally exhibited evidence for histone
hypoacetylation and reduced gene expression in disease pathogenesis. The use of HDAC
inhibitors (HDACi) to restore histone acetylation levels and gene expression of downregulated
genes has shown promise in these models but so far not in the clinic. Furthermore
the state of histone acetylation in human HD and AD brain has not been previously
characterised. This discrepancy and lack of correlation in HDACi based therapeutic
outcomes between lab and clinic formed the foundation of this current study.
Initially semi-quantitative image analysis methods were developed to quantify histone
changes. These methods were then used to investigate histone changes in the inferior
temporal gyrus and hippocampus of AD and the motor cortex, sensory cortex and cingulate
gyrus of HD post mortem brains compared to age and sex matched neurologically normal
control brains. Results obtained from semi-quantitative image analysis and Western blot
analyses collectively demonstrated that histone H4 is markedly increased (independent of
changes in total histone protein) in all regions of interest in HD brains compared to controls.
Unlike HD however, histone acetylation increases in AD brains were significantly correlated
with changes in total histone protein suggesting different mechanisms of epigenetic
deregulation at work in these two diseases. These observations from the human brain
highlight not only species differences but raise caution for current epigenome based
therapeutic strategies and highlight the need for further investigation and characterisation of
the human epigenome, in order to fully understand and develop potential epigenetic therapies
to prevent and/or alleviate AD and HD pathogenesis.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dragunow, Mike</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Faull, Richard</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Sheppard, Allan</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-03T23:58:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-03T23:58:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7153</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2171807</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Mice have significant negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade and mouse eradication is an important conservation tool. A number of mouse eradication attempts have failed for unknown reasons and basic knowledge about mouse populations on New Zealand islands was lacking so this research project was commissioned to investigate mouse biology with the aim of improving eradication attempts. A review of all mouse eradication attempts reported up to May 2007 revealed a failure rate of 38%, far higher than the 5-10% reported for invasive rat species. A series of possible reasons for mouse eradication failure were identified and these formed the basis of the rest of the research. The eradication database was updated in February 2011 and several successful eradication attempts since 2007 lead to a revised failure rate of 33%. Mouse population densities and ranging behaviour on islands were unknown so these were investigated over an 8 month period on 6 ha Saddle Island culminating in mice being successfully eradicated from the island. The worldwide distribution of mice shows they are effectively able to invade new areas but how they behave when they arrive had never been studied. In the first experiment of its kind, I experimentally released pairs of male and female mice onto Saddle Island, simulating a new invasion with each release. The released animals showed dramatic changes in behaviour which are possibly adaptations to avoid mate-finding Allee effects. Anticoagulant resistance and behavioural differences between subspecies were also identified as possible reasons for eradication failure during the database review. A phylogeographic approach was used to identify the source population and subspecies of mice obtained from island and mainland sites in New Zealand with different mouse control regimes, with the aim of identifying links between mtDNA D-loop haplotype and control outcome. Results were inconclusive but several promising avenues for further research were identified. Population genetics and trapping records were used to investigate population structure of mice living on Saddle Island prior to the eradication. Population structure was shown to change through the year and genetic analysis suggested that the population was founded by a small number of individuals. The overall conclusion of this research is that with proper planning it is possible to eradicate mice from islands and to maintain mousefree sanctuaries. A series of management recommendations drawn from this research are listed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Clout, Mick</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-04T00:15:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-04T00:15:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7155</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2168519</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

In  particular, this study involved fabricating and then evaluating the effectiveness of a range of  nanostructured zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films with different structures and chemistries (i.e. undoped  and doped) as photocatalysts, and thereafter to systematically relate: the initial and  reacted surface morphology; photocatalytic activity in terms of reaction rate; reaction  intermediates and products; and liquid phase and solid phase reaction mechanisms under both  limited and rich oxygen conditions at two different UV irradiation wavelengths (254nm and  340nm). These nanostructured thin films (i.e. undoped ZnO; nitrogen doped ZnO - N:ZnO;  cobalt doped ZnO - Co:ZnO) were produced using an innovative combination of magnetron  sputtered surfaces and hydrothermal solution deposition that allows the morphology, porosity  and thickness to be controlled by varying the composition and processing conditions. SEM,  UV-Vis, HPLC, LC-MS, AAS and XRD were used to study the changes in thin film  morphology, Methylene Blue (MB) degradation and its reaction intermediates, the presence  of Zn metal in the reaction fluid, if any, and crystallinity before and after the photocatalytic  reaction respectively.  Undoped ZnO thin films: Results showed a clear relationship between surface morphology  (and the related thin film preparation method) and photocatalytic activity for the ZnO thin  film supported catalysts: the tallest, most aligned structure had the highest photocatalytic  activity, whilst the smallest, least aligned structure had the lowest. Thus, the MB degradation  rate was the fastest for the ZnO thin film (S2-MS) with a uniform arrayed structure. Adding  oxygen made the films more stable: in oxygen-limited conditions, SEM and atomic  absorption spectroscopy indicated zinc leaching had occurred. Furthermore, with additional  oxygen the zinc leaching was minimised under the same reaction conditions. It is thought that  this additional oxygen is either minimising the release of, or replacing lost ZnO lattice  oxygens, indicating that this ZnO photocatalytic oxidation could be occurring via a Mars van  Krevelen type redox mechanism.  There was also a significant difference in MB degradation rates, as well as reaction  intermediate formation and destruction rates, correlated to the morphologies and crystallinity  at both UV wavelengths, with the highest reaction rates at 340nm. Reaction analysis indicates  that there is a competition between two different photocatalytic mechanisms: conventional  photocatalysed radical oxidation and lattice oxygen-driven oxidation. The dominant reaction  mechanism depends on the thin film morphology, crystallinity, availability of oxidant and the  wavelength of the incident UV. The surface-photocatalysed radical formation was  predominant for more aligned, highly crystalline, morphologies, where there was plentiful  oxygen and UV irradiation at 340nm. Lattice oxygen photodegradation was predominant for  the less aligned, more amorphous morphologies and UV irradiation at 254nm.  Doped (Co:ZnO) thin films: Results showed that cobalt dopant increases the photo-stability  of the corresponding undoped thin films under oxygen-limited conditions - increasing with  the increased dopant concentration. This increased stability of Co:ZnO nanostructure thin  films comes with a price, however: the photocatalytic activity and concomitant degradation  of MB and its azo dyes reaction intermediates is in general lowered, compared to the undoped  ZnO thin films. At higher dopant concentrations, under oxygen-rich conditions and with UV  irradiation at 254nm and 340nm, the MB degradation most likely occurs via a conventional  photocatalytic reaction mechanism and/or via charge transfer of the MB into Azure B (AB)  with the absence of Mars van Krevelen type mechanism (because of the increased lattice  stability). At lower dopant concentrations under oxygen-limited conditions with UV  irradiation at 254nm and 340nm, the Mars van Krevelen type reaction mechanism is probably  the main mechanism propagating the oxidation of MB.  Overall, the undoped morphologies were more photocatalytically active compared to the  doped morphologies. In general, this work has shown that several different solid and liquid  phase photocatalytic reaction mechanisms govern the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes  such as MB on nanostructured ZnO thin films, and that surface morphology, crystallinity,  lack or presence of oxygen, and the dopant concentration are the key parameters governing  the overall photocatalytic activity and the activation of these different solid and liquid  photocatalytic reaction mechanisms.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Patterson, Darrell</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Patterson, Emma</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-07T21:36:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-07T21:36:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7203</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2175461</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

However, detailed sedimentary records of the late Quaternary exist in Auckland's volcanic crater (maar) basins. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct a continuous, high-resolution record of paleoclimate from an Auckland maar, Lake Pupuke, through: (1) the construction of a detailed tephra and radiocarbon-based chronology; (2) application of a suite of proxies for environment including novel diatom stable isotopic proxies (δ18ODiatom and δ30SiDiatom); and (3) a multi-proxy reconstruction of paleolimnology from ~48 cal. kyr BP until today. A mixed-effect regression age-depth model was constructed from tephra and radiocarbon age-markers (n = 11, 13 respectively), permitting reconstruction of paleoclimate at Lake Pupuke during the last ~48 kyrs (~14 m) from biological (diatom), geochemical (TOC, TN, TS, δ13C, δ15N, ITRAX) and physical (magnetic-susceptibility, particle-size distribution) proxies for environmental and limnological change. Paleoclimatic inferences are made from δ18ODiatom and δ30SiDiatom proxies following a novel approach to tephra-contaminant removal involving physical separation and geochemical mixture modeling. Estimates of the Oxygen and Silicon contributed by basalt and rhyolite contaminants were combined with representative δ18O and δ30Si signatures to yield a basaltic and rhyolitic isotope effect. Once removed, this yielded tephra-free estimates of δ18ODiatom and δ30SiDiatom for the Pupuke paleo-record from ~48 cal. kyr BP until today. A synthesis of multi-proxy inferences on erosion, biological productivity, mixing and lake level generates robust dates for the onset of reduced effective precipitation and cooling in the Last Glacial Coldest Phase (LGCP; ~28.5-18.5 cal. kyr BP), a return to warmer, wetter climate in the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT; 18.5- 10.2 cal. kyr BP), and warmest conditions in the Holocene (post-10.2 cal. kyr BP). The LGCP, LGIT and Holocene exhibited marked paleoclimatic variation at Lake Pupuke, including harshest paleoclimate near the onset and termination of the LGCP (~27.6-26.0 and ~21.0-19.0 cal. kyr BP), a Late Glacial Reversal in climate amelioration (LGR; ~14.5-13.6 cal. kyr BP) and a Holocene rise in seasonality (from ~5.7 cal. kyr BP, intensifying from ~3.2 cal. kyr BP).</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Augustinus, Paul</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-21T23:30:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7510</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2169805</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.

In this thesis I examine two of these designs. The first is a hollow silver tube, the second two parallel copper wires. The behaviour of the first can be described by the well-known microwave theory but the behaviour of the second guide is still poorly understood. Sample sets of both were produced in several lengths, and the wire-edge separation was also varied in the case of the two-wire design. The two sample sets were characterized by THz-TDS and the results compared for losses, coupling factors and dispersion. The results for the tubes compared well to the theory displaying a predictable cutoff frequency, large dispersion and large losses. The two-wire design displays negligible dispersion as predicted for a two conductor transmission line  by the microwave theory. The measured losses propagation losses at frequencies below  0:6 compared well to predictions while losses at higher frequencies could not be readily explained.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Leonhardt, Rainer</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-08-31T21:46:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-08-31T21:46:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7546</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2204779</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

This study demonstrates that the revolted sensation in these contexts is an operation of 'othering,' from which a putative white male heterosexual subjecthood emerges. By addressing the embodied relations of this subject-hood, the thesis addresses a sensorial lack in the archive, which has obscured the continuity of an asymmetrical power relation in what is termed the 'post-colonial' era. Refusing the critical safety of a post-colonial condition, this thesis argues that we exist in a 'colonial present.' In the 'present,' colonialism is preserved in our sensorial relation to the world, which informs our national identity as New Zealanders. In both the colonial Pacific and the settler-colonial New Zealand contexts, this disgusted subject-hood is expressed in and through different constellations of 'colonizing aesthetics,' which this thesis terms the 'disgust-beauty amalgam' of colonial subjectivity. Two separate geographical contexts are utilized to demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way disgust functions in respective colonial environments. In the eighteenth-century Pacific, the indigenous body is represented in monstrous and excessive ways by the disgust-beauty complex, which functions to make it irrevocably Other to the colonial subject in the moment of encounter. Concerning Aotearoa New Zealand, this study demonstrates the ways in which disgust informs the invention of a national identity in settler-colonial states. By addressing the temporal stability of the constructed norm of a 'New Zealander,' as embodied by a white male heterosexual Pākehā, this thesis shows the way disgust continues to naturalise the bodies of these second settlers in this place over time. The way in which the settler subject aesthetically codes the bodies of both indigenous (Māori) and exogenous (migrant) in New Zealand as variously 'beautiful' and 'revolting' others demonstrates the ongoing function of disgust in authorising settler-colonial presence in this country. In addressing the greasy embodied matter which disgusts us, this thesis suggests the ways colonial aversions remain embedded in our sensorium: it is an embodied nationalism distinguishing 'self' from ʻother'.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Turner, Stephen</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-09-15T20:19:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-15T20:19:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7962</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2300550</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Activation of the  PI3K/Akt pathway in response to growth factor regulates cell functions by  phosphorylating the Forkhead box (Fox) O subfamily of transcription factors. The  FOXO family plays a crucial role in many aspects of development and functions of an  organism, including tumorigenesis.  All four members of the FOXO subfamily identified (FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4, and  FOXO6) have overlapping roles in regulating cell death and cell cycle arrest that they  function as tumour suppressors. Transcriptional activity of FOXO is regulated by  Akt/PKB phosphorylation and nuclear export. Unphosphorylated FOXO in the  nucleus FOXO is active for transcription regulation whereas phosphorylated FOXO is  inactivated and is subsequently exported from the nucleus for proteasomal  degradation. The aim of this project is using FOXO-inducible luciferase reporters to  monitor nuclear changes of FOXO levels in response to PI3K inhibitors. Ultimately,  this system would be used in vivo for monitoring real-time progression of tumours.  Here we showed that sole transduction of the lentiviral FOXO-luciferase reporter or  transfection of the DNA-based FOXO-luciferase reporter was not sufficient for  detecting the effects of well-known PI3K inhibitors. This is due to the low levels of  active FOXO proteins in the nucleus. We also showed that transduction of additional  FOXO3a recombinant together with the FOXO-luciferase reporter into certain cancer  cell lines, significant changes of luciferase activity in response to PI3K inhibitors  and/or insulin could be observed.  According to our results, we concluded that with additional stable transduction of  exogenous FOXO3a, cell lines that stably expressing FOXO-luciferase may be used  in vivo as pharmacodynamic markers for screening cancer drugs targeting the PI3K  pathway.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Shepherd, Peter</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Buchanan, Christina</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-09-25T23:09:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-25T23:09:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/8267</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2272594</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Additionally, this study sought to identify whether the  clinicians’ knowledge, perceptions and practice differences were based on the  clinicians’ years or practice or experience, strength of religious beliefs, professional  position and ethnicity.  Design: A descriptive design involving mixed method approach was utilised and the  study was conducted in two phases.  Setting: Five acute medical wards of a general district hospital which is located in  South Auckland, New Zealand.  Participants: All the clinicians were employed in one of the five study wards and  had some experience with direct care of end life patients and or NFR decisions. The  clinicians had a diverse range of clinical experiences, ethnic background, strength of  religious beliefs and professional positions.  Methods: In phase one, a total of 55/80 (response rate 69%) nurses and 16/40  (response rate 40%) doctors completed a self-administered questionnaire. This was  followed by phase two in which eleven nurses participated in two separate focus  group discussions. There were three participants in the doctors’ focus group  discussion. The questionnaire data was analysed quantitatively via SPSS (Statistical  Package for the Social Sciences) and generated descriptive statistics. The focus  group discussion data was analysed qualitatively resulting in a number of themes.  Results: A variety of stimulating results were revealed from both, questionnaire and  focus group data. Data from the questionnaire and the focus group discussions were  consistent with a few mixed results. The majority (91%) of clinicians reported that  they had not received any training pertaining to NFR decisions and or end of life  patients. There was evidence of uncertainty and lack of knowledge amongst  clinicians regarding the legal interpretation of NFR decision. A wide range of  clinicians’ perceptions, attitudes and clinical practices regarding NFR decisions was reported. Additionally, a number of clinicians’ attitudes, perceptions and clinical  practices reached statistical significance and appeared to be influenced by clinicians’  years of practice, professional position, strength of religious beliefs and ethnicity.  Furthermore, the findings of the focus group discussions revealed numerous  difficulties that clinicians faced when making CPR/NFR decisions for the end of life  patients.  Conclusion: Clinicians need education, training and support both in undergraduate  training programmes and clinical practice regarding end of life patient care and  decisions. Enhanced training and support will not only reduce the complexities of  DNR decisions but also reduce pain and suffering. Hence, better patient outcome can be achieved.</dc:description><dc:description>Available to authenticated members of The University of Auckland.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Stewart, Lisa</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dixon, Robyn</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-09-29T22:13:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-09-29T22:13:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/8298</dc:identifier><dc:relation>Masters Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2207358</dc:relation><dc:rights>Restricted Item.

Views linked to relational marketing,  service-dominant logic, and experiential marketing represent some of the main  paradigm shifts in marketing which challenge the traditional transactional view. Within  these theoretical shifts the term 'brand', already ubiquitous due to its long history (Stern  2006), has been recast and enlarged. The importance of service branding had already  been established by Berry (2000). Then within a service-dominant logic framing (Vargo  and Lusch 2004a; 2004b; 2008), the brand was given a central relational, co-creational  role (Brodie, Glynn and Little 2006). In an experience economy the brand is enlarged  even more to include the whole consumption experience (Haathi 2003). The brand is  also posited as a socially constructed text (Hatch and Rubin 2006).  In this study I have focused on the experience of employees in constructing the  brand of a large service organisation which has a strong brand and relies on employee  'buy in' to fulfill its brand promises to its customer base. I used a narrative approach in  designing the study, and then generating and analysing data (both verbal and visual).  This method, combined with a three-phase focus group and individual interview design,  created a rich picture of one particular organisational context. My aim was to explore  how employees constructed the brand by revealing a complex picture of the brand  experience of the participants who took part.  The main findings reveal a multi-faceted brand that is viewed from various  perspectives. This construction is contradictory, paradoxical, and complex. I highlight  theoretical touch points from the accepted canon which both inform and are informed  by the views of my participants. In doing so I present a narrative construction of the  brand which can be incorporated by these various branding frameworks but which is  not fully explained by them either. The narrated brand reveals the brand ultimately as  a mutable mirror from and through which the narrator constructs her/his brand identity. Thus the narrated brand revealed in this work presents an unstable (Harding 2007),  identity-based view of the employee's brand experience which affirms the adoption of a  narrative approach in such qualitative research.  This thesis, therefore, makes three main contributions: a theoretical one in that this  study reveals a complex view of the employee perceived brand; a methodological one  in that the use of narrative analysis is enlarged within the marketing discipline, and, in  particular, in relation to the brand as it pertains to the employee; and a managerial one  in that unveiling the complexity of the employee's construction of the brand may help  organisations better understand how current models and systems (which may be either  simple or complicated) map onto the complex brand realities experienced by  employees. Finally, this study, though limited to a qualitative, single embedded case  study, provides a rich way ahead for further research into the construction of the brand  experience to be conducted and extended.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Buchanan-Oliver, Margo</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-10-03T00:32:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-03T00:32:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/8306</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2188653</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Among them, the management of consistency  across multiple representations is particularly complex yet it lacks effective tool support. The  thesis proposes an automated support mechanism to enable users (Requirements Engineers) to  manage the consistency and validation of requirements. We have investigated existing  approaches, developed a novel technique, and realised this technique as an automated support  tool called MaramaAI (Automated Inconsistency Checker).  We have taken an iterative approach to our work. We began by developing a lightweight  extraction approach that allows an accurate and quick extraction of essential requirements  (abstract interactions) from natural language requirements and the generation of Essential Use  Case models from them. We then used automated traceability with visual support to check the  consistency of requirements in three different forms: textual natural language requirements,  abstract interaction and Essential Use Case, as well as to further validate the correctness and  completeness of requirements. We also extended the automated tool to provide end-to-end rapid  prototyping support embedded in the tool for validating requirements consistency in a form usable  by both requirement engineers and clients to confirm the consistency of requirements.  We have evaluated the tool's efficacy and performance especially on the extraction process, and  also evaluated the user perception on the tool's usability and user-perceived strengths via a  substantial usability study and applied the tool to several case studies. The results were positive,  and demonstrate that MaramaAI can be used to manage the consistency and validation of  requirements in various domains of applications.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Hosking, John</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Grundy, John</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-10-18T23:19:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-10-18T23:19:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/8357</dc:identifier><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA2202265</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
