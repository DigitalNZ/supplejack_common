This knowledge has motivated substantial research and development into wireless signal transmission which today is competitive with traditional conductive cabling systems. Power transfer across air gaps, however, has seen more modest development and has tended to be restricted to electric machines that have tight magnetic couplings. It is only very recently that a novel technique termed IPT (Inductive Power Transfer) has made power delivery to movable objects across large air gaps a practical reality. A typical IPT system comprises a primary power converter supplying high frequency alternating current to a conductive track loop with multiple secondary power pick-up circuits loosely coupled to it. IPT employs modern power conversion, control, and magnetic coupling techniques to achieve clean and reliable power transfer without direct electrical contact. Many practical applications have been found for IPT in materials handing, lighting, and transportation systems. One of the major constraints, however, is the primary power supply, particularly at high power levels and when power transfer over large distances is required. In this thesis selected resonant converters suitable for IPT power supplies are investigated using mathematical analysis, computer simulations and practical experiments. The basic characteristics and underlying principles of the converters are studied in order to determine their dynamic performance and power transfer capability. Special attention is given to improving existing IPT power supplies while investigating new power converters in order to achieve high efficiency and reliable operation at reduced cost. The current-fed parallel resonant converter power supply has been the basis of most commercial applications to date. It has a high efficiency and produces good voltage and current waveforms. However, both the track length that it can drive and the power level it can operate at are limited and the system may vary in frequency if the track resonant circuit and the pick-up load are not carefully designed. As a result, this supply, in its simple form, is only suitable for short track lengths and low power applications. The voltage-fed series ii quasi-resonant converter power supply controls the frequency directly and is capable of driving longer track lengths as a result of series compensation employed in the track loop. However, its voltage and current waveforms contain more harmonics, and while high efficiency may be achieved with soft switching, the condition is very dependent on the track compensation and is difficult to meet during start-up and shut down transients. In consequence, this supply is suitable for medium track lengths and medium power level applications. Improved current-fed and voltage-fed IPT power supplies are proposed in this thesis. They have the most preferred track current properties, including constant magnitude and nearly pure sine wave characteristics. Despite the circuit complexity and high system cost involved, these supplies are ideally suitable for long track lengths and high power applications. A novel converter based on free oscillation and energy injection control is also presented and shown to be capable of achieving high frequency AC power generation at very low switching frequencies while reducing the system cost. As such it is appealing for long track length, high track current, high frequency, and low voltage source applications. Finally, a very simple converter based on self-sustained oscillation without an external controller is demonstrated at low operating voltages, and a cost-effective option to overcome the start-up problems exhibited by most IPT power supplies at high voltages is shown with excellent dynamic zero voltage switching performance.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted, but available by request, use the feedback form to request access.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Boys, John T</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Electrical and Electronic Engineering)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1013314</dc:relation><dc:rights>Whole document restricted but available by request.

Such is the aim of this thesis: to discover the 'real man' behind the statistics about sex-roles and the predominance of male characters in children's and adolescents' literature. From within a selection of Spanish texts a variety of male characters are analysed, focusing on six major roles: father, grandfather, imaginary friend, detective, outlaw or similar marginalised man, and foreign other, with particular attention paid to the Gypsy.    All the chapters are linked by the Bakhtinian theory that dialogue with the other leads to the development of a character's or potential reader's sense of identity. The first chapter, concerning fatherhood, is related to a person's sense of intrinsic identity, given with their name and genetic heritage. The grandfather represents a similar sense of family continuity, as well as enabling the young reader to understand Spain's recent historical and rural past. An imaginary friend may symbolise an aspect of identity concerned with a child's ability to achieve a goal or to occupy a special place within the family. Detective stories are analogous to the young person's developing identity as a reader able to decipher the mysteries of texts, whilst marginalised men typify children themselves: persons who have neither status nor money, but who are able to indulge in carnivalistic behaviour which adults call 'play.' The development of one's sense of national identity is fomented through interaction with texts about foreigners who have contributed to Spain's growth as a nation from pre-historic times to the present.    A brief critical evaluation of the role of women in detective fiction and as marginalised figures is offered by way of contrast in the appropriate chapters. The thesis concludes that, when analysed as individuals, many male characters demonstrate traits not traditionally considered masculine, and that it is necessary to look beyond mere representations of gender in judging the value of characters in literature for children and adolescents.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted, but available by request, use the feedback form to request access.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr. Christine Arkinstall</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Spanish)--University of Auckland, 1997.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9841949</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA689880</dc:relation><dc:rights>Whole document restricted but available by request.

An extensive review of available design techniques revealed a wide range of equations and proposed design procedures but no generally accepted method for riprap sizing and implementation. The aim of this study was to develop a design procedure for riprap protection at piers which can be used in most river environments.    The failure mechanisms and stability of riprap layers around cylindrical and rectangular shaped piers were examined in a comprehensive experimental study. The study assessed the importance of various riprap, flow, sediment, and pier parameters. Parameters for investigation were determined by dimensional analysis and included riprap placement and arrangement.    A riprap size prediction formula was developed based on an allowable maximum local scour depth of up to 20%. This equation has been incorporated in a design approach which was tested through a model study of the Hutt Estuary Bridge. The influence of various parameters on riprap stability are incorporated in the equation by way of adjustment factors.    The adjustment factors, KY and KD, represent the effects of riprap placement and pier/sediment size ratio effects respectively. They were deemed the most important parameters in riprap layer performance and are therefore included in the riprap size prediction formula. Additional experiments using synthetic filters have shown their ability to eliminate local scour, however they are susceptible to failure under degrading bed conditions.    Degrading bed conditions cause the riprap to subside as a layer with the downward movement of the surrounding bed. Subsidence allows the layer to withstand rapid short term degradation. However long term degradation will ultimately result in failure of the stone protection.    A preliminary experimental study of the use of submerged vanes as a scour countermeasure was performed. Submerged vanes have been used previously in channel protection with much success. Results indicate that vanes with a length to height ratio greater than one can reduce the maximum local scour depth in live bed conditions by as much as 34%. Further testing is required to develop a complete design procedure.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor B.W.

The process has been viewed as an example of organisational change and the focus is on the relationship between formal and informal caregivers and the notion of care. Three key groups were included in the study, families of residents, the residents and staff.    A qualitative approach was taken. The theoretical perspective that was developed attempted to account for links between social movements, organisations and individual experience in the arena of intellectual disability. This was based on the approach of New Institutionalism in organisational theory. The focus was primarily on the process--of change, and in caregiving.    Three models of intellectual disability, which have informed policy and the recent changes to a preference for community care, have been identified and the links between these and the elements of organisations developed for providing care explored. The experience of families and residents within the hospital setting and then the community care setting has been examined in relation to the nature of the organisation.    Outcomes for the three groups have been examined in terms of their needs and the extent to which these needs were met by the arrangements over a given time. It is concluded that community care has the potential to better meet the needs of those involved, than has hospital based care. A number of factors in the process of change and in the delivery of care have been identified as impacting on outcomes for those involved. Consideration is given to the practical implications of these findings.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Community Health)--University of Auckland, 1996.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9820238</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA783483</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

This study aims to develop ‘systematic opportunistic screening’ for diabetes, testing people attending a general practitioner (GP) for some other reason, and to trial this process with Auckland GPs. The literature on how to change doctor behaviour is reviewed for both theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence. Two of the most promising strategies are computer reminders within a medical consultation and having patients influence doctors. Literature reviews cover GP attitudes to diabetes, guidelines and preventive care and the role of a computer in a GP consultation.    The Mail Survey (response rate 154/212, 72.6%) reports GP attitudes to guidelines and preventive care. Factor analysis showed five ‘guidelines’ factors and two ‘preventive care’ factors that might indicate differential motivations to screening for diabetes.    The Focus Group Study, of 35 GPs in 5 groups, discussed guidelines, diabetes and computer reminders in a consultation. The analysis suggested that GPs would respond to a patient reminder and may respond to a computer reminder to screen for diabetes.    The Screening Reminder Trial involved 107 GPs randomly allocated across four interventions: Computer reminders, Patient reminders, Both and Usual care. The main outcome measures were whether a patient who was eligible for diabetes screening and who visited a GP during the trial had a glucose test done within the trial. The trial ran for two months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and allowed for clustering by GP. Compared with the Usual care group (screening rate 15.5%), the Odds Ratio of eligible patients being screened were; Computer group OR 2.55 (1.68-3.88), Patient group OR 1.72 (1.21-2.43) and Both group OR 1.69 (1.11-2.59). The Computer reminders were more acceptable to GPs than were the Patient intervention. The findings suggest that a simple computer reminder can implement systematic opportunistic screening for diabetes in New Zealand. If all GPs in New Zealand used the computer reminders for one year, some 8000 patients might benefit from having their diabetes treated for five years longer than they would have under ‘usual care’.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--General Practice)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3155372</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1241429</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

learn effectively, and that this applies no less to language than to any other field of
learning. After issues of terminology and definition are addressed, there is a
discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of the language learning strategy concept.
Since the concept of proficiency is also central to the thesis, issues relating to the
definition and assessment of proficiency are considered before previous research in
the language learning strategy field is reviewed.
This research was carried out in three stages in a private language school in Auckland,
New Zealand. Part A, Section 1 used the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning
(SILL) (Oxford, 1990) as the basic instrument to investigate the relationship between
language learning strategies and proficiency and to examine the strategy patterns used
by more proficient students. Part A, Section 2 used the same data to investigate
language learning strategy use according to learner variables (nationality, gender,
age). Part B used interviews to investigate language learning strategy use by
individuals and Part C used a classroom based programme to explore means of
instructing students in language learning strategy use and also to construct an original
questionnaire using student input (the English Language Learning Strategy Inventory
or ELLSI). This questionnaire was used to further investigate the relationship between
language learning strategy use and proficiency and also changes in strategy use over
time as well as teachers’ perspectives on language learning strategy use. The results of the SILL phase of the study revealed a significant relationship between
language learning strategies and proficiency (a finding supported by the results of the
ELLSI study) and also significant differences in strategy use according to nationality,
while the interviews revealed some useful insights regarding the use of language
learning strategies by individuals. From the longitudinal section of the study it was
found that those students who made the most progress were the ones who most
increased the frequency of their language learning strategy use. The results of the
teachers’ survey indicated that teachers regarded language learning strategies as
highly important, an encouraging result in terms of positive implications for a good
accord between teachers and students in the teaching/learning situation. The
classroom programme, however, aimed at exploring ways to promote language
learning strategy use among students, was only a lukewarm success and much work
remains to be done to find ways of making insights regarding language learning
strategies available to students.
The thesis concludes by bringing together the key findings and suggesting areas for
further research.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr Judy Parr</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/9</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3094436</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1142690</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The full-length human $/beta/sb7$ cDNA contains 2798 nucleotides encoding a single long open reading frame of 798 amino acid residues of which 708 are extracellular and 52 are cytoplasmic. The human $/beta/sb7$ sequence displays strong homology with other integrin $/beta$ subunits, being most related to $/beta/sb2$. Cell distribution studies suggest that the expression of transcripts encoding the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit is restricted to leukocytes. This study was the first to show that the cysteine-rich repeats of the human integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit and other integrin $/beta$ subunits are related to domain III of the laminin B chains. Furthermore, the integrin $/beta$ subunit and laminin cysteine-rich repeats are each related to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats found in a growing number of adhesion molecules and regulatory proteins.    The mouse homologue of the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit has also been cloned in this study, and it shares 87% amino acid identity with the human $/beta/sb7$ sequence. The mouse $/beta/sb7$ mRNA transcripts, like that of the human $/beta/sb7$, have a predominantly leukocyte-restricted expression, but in some haematopoietic lineage cell lines, in addition to the predominant 3 kb transcript, a less abundant 2 kb transcript is also detectable. Cultured mouse skin epithelial cells contain only the 2 kb transcript.    The genes encoding the human and mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunits were mapped to human chromosome 12 (ITGB7) and mouse chromosome 15 (Itgb-7). The Itgb-7 gene was localised to the distal part of mouse chromosome 15, and exists in the gene order: Myc-Wnt-1-Itgb-1.    The N-terminal 13 amino acids of the mature mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunit was shown to be identical to a 13 amino acid N-terminal sequence reported for the Mr 120,000 $/beta$ subunit of the M290 antigen, which is found highly expressed on mouse intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL).

In his descriptions of the peasantry and modern high-energy cultures of progress Berger insightfully crystallises and represents graphically the observation made by many authors writing in different contexts and from within various disciplines that there have been two fundamentally different systems of beliefs and values in history. His conception of ‘ cultures of survival’ and ‘cultures of progress ’ is used in this thesis to develop a conceptual model for sustainability.    The basic idea underlying the conceptual model for sustainability is that cultural systems self-regulate or self-correct as they strive to achieve balance in their relationship to higher systems levels of the biosphere, while improving quality of life. Over large time scales self-regulation takes the form of quite radical transformations in cultural system's key defining beliefs and values. The model holds that the process of self-regulation results in societies moving back and forth along a cultural continuum of beliefs and values, represented at one end by Berger's cultures of survival and at the other by his cultures of progress. This system of self-regulation is fraught with risks arising from factors like the inherently conservative nature of cultural systems, which reduce the fit or alignment between systems of beliefs and values and their context and in doing so generate un-sustainability. The model suggests that over large spans of time movement back and forth along the cultural continuum creates the dynamic balance needed to achieve greater sustainability, at least if irreversible degradation of the biosphere's life-supporting systems and extinction can be avoided. This conceptual model for sustainability demonstrates the validity of the central hypothesis of the thesis, which is that Berger's ideas in the ‘Historical Afterword’ to ‘Pig Earth’ are important and have a valuable contribution to make to the discourse on sustainability.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Planning)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/11</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3175249</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1473402</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics are represented by a log-normally distributed distance dependent path-loss. For simplicity, the received signal variability attributable to multi-path fading is ignored.    The mobile radio system performance is estimated using outage probability expressions, where an outage is defined to occur when the momentary BER exceeds a specified threshold rate. The in-building and outdoor mobile radio systems are assumed to use power control and the composite interference is assumed to be Gaussian distributed at the mobile radio receivers.    Outage probability expressions which predict the performance of a fixed service sharing spectrum with a mobile radio system are developed. The fixed service is assumed to experience occasional multi-path fading attributable to unusual tropospheric conditions. The maximum tolerable mobile radio interference at a fixed service receiver depends on the performance requirements of the service. However a commonly used Standard which requires that the INR is less than -16dB has been adopted in this Thesis, and therefore an outage is defined to occur when the CNR ratio is less than the minimum required for reliable reception, or when the INR exceeds -16dB.    Sufficient electromagnetic isolation between fixed and mobile systems sharing the same spectrum may be achieved using excision suppression techniques or by geographically separating the two systems. Excision suppression techniques will have a detrimental effect on the performance of a mobile radio system unless the fixed service signal is sufficiently narrow-band. The geographical separation distances required for spectrum sharing between fixed services, and outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems are presented. The fixed services are assumed to be similar to those operating in New Zealand in the 1.7-2.3 GHz frequency bands. Mobile radio systems with 5, 10, 15 and 48 MHz channels are considered. It is shown that, for the systems considered, the geographical separation required between the two systems depends largely on the mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics, and the mobile radio and fixed service transmission powers.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Electrical and Electronic Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1997.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/12</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9824384</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA755015</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Crucial to an understanding of this is the Sartre quotation in Winterspelt . According to Sartre's ‘original project’, the individual human being starts off life as a rough outline, which lives itself subjectively, filtering objective reality through its own preconceptions and thus experiencing nothing which is not part of these preconceptions. As a painter creates an outline on a blank canvas, so we create the outline of our own lives and determin our destiny.    In Andersch's novels, which are set against the existential void, the fate of the characters is never predetermined; rather, it is the individual's line of thinking which determines his or her course of action, and determines the nature of his or her relationships with others. As Andersch's characters become more aware of their freedom as human beings, they are able to develop conscious artistic outlines and so turn the existential void into a place of freedom. This thesis looks at four closely interrelated aspects of the artistic outline: ‘Lines of Thought’, ‘The Development of Outlines’, ‘New Directions’ and ‘Co-existence and convergence: the individual artistic outline as part of a whole’. By showing the development of these aspects across the four novels, it draws conclusions not only about Alfred Andersch's development as a writer but also about his vision of humanity.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--German)--University of Auckland, 1999.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/13</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9964815</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA893711</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The purpose of this study is to present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of major unilateral, regional and multilateral trade liberalization on Sri Lanka, and rank the trade policy options in terms of their welfare effects. This study contributes to the empirical literature on trade liberalization. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model is used to analyze the welfare effects of trade liberalization in a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium framework. The results show that if Sri Lanka implements the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), while maintaining 15 percent external tariffs for the rest of the world, this combined policy would provide the highest welfare gain to Sri Lanka. The SAFTA by its own would provide the second-highest ranked gain from the trade reforms due to the benefits of preferential access to the large SAARC market. The third-highest ranked policy option comes under the unilateral reduction of import tariffs to 15 percent scenario. As results indicate, the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ILFTA) offers the fourth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Finally, the phasing-out of MFA on Textiles and Clothing under the Uruguay Round Agreement, rank as the fifth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Thus, regional trade liberalization is far more preferable to unilateral and multilateral liberalization. However, as the GTAP model permits, these rankings based on only to the static welfare gains, ignoring the dynamic effect of trade liberalization.    In addition, the gravity model has been employed to examine the determinants of Sri Lanka's bilateral trade flows with her selected trading partners, in order to sort out the influence of geographical proximity versus preferential trading policies in creating a regional concentration in trade. Our results confirm the validity of geographical factors such as proximity and cultural familiarity, as determinants of Sri Lanka's trade with neighbouring countries. They suggest that the selected trading partners are “natural trading partners” of Sri Lanka.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Economics)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/14</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3120046</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1225985</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

However, our knowledge of the role of this ion in the plant cell is limited, and the mechanisms of homeostasis and transport of the ion are almost completely unknown. A. Tutone (this laboratory) identified an Arabidopsis thaliana gene by the complementation of a Mg2+-uptake yeast mutant (CM66). This gene, referred to as AtMRS2-11, was expressed as cDNA from a strong yeast promoter and allowed the growth of the CM66 yeast strain on standard media. The conceptually translated AtMRS2-11 protein sequence was used in this study to identify nine additional proteins by sequence homology searches using the BLAST algorithm. The corresponding genes have been cloned from cDNA (A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta) and sequenced. Protein sequence similarity suggests that the family forms a sub-section of the CorA super-family of Mg2+ transport proteins. The mutant yeast used to identify the family initially was also used to show that two family members in addition to AtMRS2-11 were able to complement the Mg2+-dependent growth phenotype. When fused to eGFP, these proteins showed a localisation consistent with some of the protein reaching the yeast cell membrane. The other members of the family were also fused to eGFP and showed a range of localisation patterns within the yeast cell. None of the three AtMRS2 proteins previously able to complement the yeast mutant phenotype did so when fused to eGFP. RNA transcripts from the AtMRS2 family were detected by RT-PCR in organ-scale preparations of total RNA from A. thaliana. Most family members were detected in all of the organs tested. Northern analysis of AtMRS2-11 RNA transcript level showed that the gene was more highly expressed in leaf tissue, but was not affected by decreased levels of Mg2+ in the growth media. The levels of steady state AtMRS2-11 mRNA transcript were elevated two-fold in the light during the diurnal cycle, but no change was detected during light-induced greening of etiolated seedlings. A stable transgenic A. thaliana line expressing the gusA gene from the promoter region of AtMRS2-11 was used to localise the promoter's activity to cells containing chloroplasts. The expression appeared highest in younger cells. VI The AtMRS2-11 protein was predicted to contain a chloroplast targeting peptide. Western analysis demonstrated that AtMRS2-11 was enriched in the total proteins of isolated chloroplasts as compared to extracts from whole plants. The AtMRS2-11:eGFP fusion protein was also detected in chloroplasts by fluorescence microscopy. Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy was used in conjunction with isolated chloroplasts to try to determine the effects of the overaccumulation of the AtMRS2-11 protein in a transgenic A. thaliana plant line (constructed by A. Tutone). A rapid uptake or binding of Mg2+ was seen in chloroplasts isolated from both wild type and transgenic lines, but no differences were observed in either the rate of Mg2+ uptake/binding or the final Mg2+ content.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/15</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1498318</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Napier's invention of logarithms (with greatly advanced spherical trigonometry) was published in 1614 as Descriptio Canonis Logarithmorum; whereupon the mathematicians of Europe instantly acclaimed Napier as the greatest of them all. In 1617 he published Rabdologiae, which explained several devices for aiding calculation: (1) numbering rods to aid multiplication (known as 'Napier's bones'); (2) other rods to aid evaluation of square and cube roots; (3) the first publication of binary arithmetic, as far as square root extraction; and (4) the Promptuary for multiplication of numbers (up to 10 digits each), which has a strong claim to be regarded as the first calculating machine. Napier's explanation of the construction of his logarithms was published posthumously in 1619 as Constructio Canonis Logarithmorum, in which he developed much of the differential calculus in order to define his logarithms as the solution of a differential equation and then constructed strict upper and lower bounds for the solution. His incomplete manuscript on arithmetic and algebra (written in the early 1590s) was published in 1839 as De Arte Logistica.    This thesis provides the first English translations of De Arte Logistica and of Rabdologiae, and it reprints Edward Wright's English translation (1616) of the Descriptio and W. R. Macdonald's English translation (1889) of the Constructio. Extensive commentaries are given on Napier's work on arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. The history of trigonometry is traced from ancient Babylonia and Greece through mediaeval Islam to Renaissance Europe. Napier's logarithms (and spherical trigonometry) resulted in an explosion of logarithms over most of the world, with European ships using logarithms for navigation as far as Japan by 1640.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>1982</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 1978</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/16</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/8804680</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA219210</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Over the past decade there has been an increase in interest in the expression of spiritual belief in work. Most of the writing on the topic is based on the premise that individuals and organisations have lost meaning, and that the problem of meaning in work needs to addressed to enhance the ways in which we organise, and to enhance organisational output and personal wellbeing. Whereas the current writing on spirituality and work often suggests that organisations should provide more meaning, this research took a more humble starting point by asking what meanings individuals with spiritual belief are currently attributing to, and discovering in, their work, and by asking how and whether these meanings determine work behaviour.    I argue in this thesis that the concept of meaning-making is central to spirituality. I reviewed the psychological literature on meaning and as a result decided to focus the inquiry on three core elements of meaning; purpose, sense-making and coherence. In order to step back from the organisational agenda, and give voice to the authenticity of diverse spiritual beliefs, I chose to use career, rather than organisational theory, as framework for this inquiry. An additional theoretical framework of ‘agency and communion’ was introduced to conceptualise human motivation beyond its current narrow ‘self’ and ‘doing’ oriented definitions. A combination of ‘collaborative human inquiry’ and ‘narrative’ methodology was chosen to elicit subjective career meanings. Fifteen individuals with diverse spiritual beliefs participated in this research. These included a Buddhist, a Quaker, a Catholic, a Bahá'í, and a Mormon, as well as those not currently affiliated with an organized religion.    The findings show that spiritual belief strongly determines career choice, transition and experience. It was found that research participants, in spite of their diverse beliefs, shared four purposes: ‘developing and becoming self’, ‘union with others’, ‘expressing self’ and ‘serving others’. When these purposes can be expressed fully, the workplace is experienced to be aligned with spiritual belief, and individuals are contributing fully, especially when diversity of spiritual expressions is acknowledged at the same time. Career transitions are made through an ongoing sense-making process as a result of which the individual may decide that the four purposes are no longer in balance and action is required in order to continue to live meaningfully. This sensemaking is a result of ongoing interaction between the individual and his or her work environment. Coherence is a result of the transrational element of spirituality, when the individual feels his or her work is still aligned with a bigger (divine) plan. This is assessed on an ongoing basis through prayer, asking ‘was this meant to be’ and reframing difficulties and setbacks as opportunities for learning and development.    I suggest that it may not be wise to seek collective enactment of the trans-rational as it has no firm basis for collective organisational decision-making. It cannot seek collective expression due to the diversity of beliefs of organisational members. However I strongly suggest that an organisation that wants to align itself with the spiritual beliefs of its members, ensures that the four purposes of ‘developing and becoming self’, ‘union with others’, ‘expressing self’ and ‘serving others’ can be fully enacted in the organisation, keeping in mind that spirituality expresses itself in process as well as outcome.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Management and employment relations)--University of Auckland, 1999.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/18</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9969054</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA916236</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Polytechnic business programmes are used as a case study to illustrate the impact of the reforms and of one of the principal mechanisms by which the reforms were expected to be implemented-the National Framework.    Evidence is provided that leads to policy questions regarding the implementation of the Framework under the aegis of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. These concerns include competency based learning and administration and delivery complexities. The links between the reform intentions and the actuality of implementation are also examined. The assumption that the education reforms are expected to have significant impact on the country's economic performance is examined and factors which impact on workplace organisation and productivity and which may constrain the effects of improved worker education and training are discussed. The instrument of ‘the market’ as a means of achieving both efficiencies and effectiveness in tertiary education is also reviewed. There appears to be an absence of a common understanding of the nature, composition and behaviour of education markets.    Indicative evidence is also provided regarding the complexity of student investment decisions with regard to tertiary education decisions. This study provides evidence to support human capital theory as a force influencing the decision to undertaken tertiary education, but as part of a much more complex model of the tertiary education decision making process than it would appear that policy makers have considered.    Evidence is presented that leads to questions regarding the assumption that industry will take ownership of the reform processes. Evidence is presented of industry indifference and inertia to the reforms.    Recommendations for the re-examination of developments to date are made, together with research programmes to provide a sound empirical base for future policy making. Without a structured critical review of the reform intentions versus the emerging actuality, there is a danger that the reforms may, in part at least, prove to be both inefficient and ineffectual.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1999.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/19</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9950433</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA894594</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Using evidence obtained from contemporary violoncello methods, periodical reviews, iconographic materials, diaries, letters, musical manuscripts, first-edition performance repertoire, and first-hand research at the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institute and University of California at Berkeley, the technical methodology of each school is examined. By this process, diverse qualities in the playing manner of J. P. Duport, J. L. Duport, Janson, Tricklir, Breval, J. H. Levasseur, Lamare, Hus-Desforges, Baudiot, Norblin, Vaslin and Franchomme, and that of A. Kraft, Ritter, Romberg, N. Kraft, Dotzauer, Lincke, Bohrer, Merk and Kummer are discernible.    Such divergences in bowing technique form the basis of dissimilarities present in French and Austro-German violoncello performance of 1785-1839, a circumstance occasioned by a variety of contributing factors. These issues are segregated for investigation. Following the Introduction, Chapters 1 and 2 provide background information regarding the development of the instrument, bow, and bowing techniques before 1785. Chapter 3 discusses design modifications that occurred to the instrument and bow between 1785 and 1839. Chapters 4 and 5 present the biographies of each of the violoncellists examined, while Chapter 6 discusses the influence of performers from the French violin school and the musician interaction brought about by the French Revolution and subsequent wars.    Analysis of the varying performance characteristics of the French and Austro-German schools begins with Chapter 7, this chapter and Chapter 8 surveying the performance methodology of each of the violoncellists included in this study. Chapters 9 and 10 assess the consequential relationship of performance technique to performance repertoire and Chapter 11 summarizes the findings of the accomplished research.    These findings detail differences in the performance methodology of the French, Austrian and German violoncello schools in the period 1785-1839. The variants evinced include the manner in which the bow and instrument were held, the type of bowing techniques incorporated into the performance repertoire of each nationality and the method of their execution, the way in which the violoncello's varying sonorities were exploited, and the regard for sound quality and volume by performers of each school.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Music)--University of Auckland, 1993.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/20</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9424418</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA530263</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The majority of species have been described from only a handful of specimens. Found in deep ocean waters, these species are widespread and often sexually dimorphic. Little is known of intra-specific variation in morphology, and many species are very similar in external appearance. A reference database of mitochondrial DNA sequences was compiled for all 20 recognised ziphiid species to aid in species identification. All reference sequences were derived from validated specimens, which were often represented only by bone or teeth. DNA was obtained from this ‘historic’ material using ‘ancient’ DNA methods. For three species, holotypes were sampled. Phylogenetic analyses using this database led to the discovery of a new, previously unrecognised species of beaked whale (Mesoplodon perrini), new specimens of Longman's beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus), a species known previously from only two partial skulls and the synonymy of a third (M. traversii = M. bahamondi).    Phylogenetic reconstructions based on sequence data from three mitochondrial and two nuclear loci (total, 2815 bp) using neighbour joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods, resolved many of the sister-species relationships in this group. Inferred relationships among Mesoplodon beaked whales indicated that cranial and tooth morphology may be far more variable between closely related species than previously assumed. No support was found for a linear-progression of tooth form as suggested by Moore (1968) in his phenetic evaluation of relationships among the Ziphiidae. The geographic distribution of Mesoplodon species with similar or divergent tooth morphology is likely due to a combination of sexual selection and selection for species recognition. Both hypotheses predict similar patterns, such as dissimilar tooth morphology among species with sympatric or parapatric distributions. However, only sexual selection appears to offer an explanation for why there are so many Mesoplodon beaked whales.    Investigation of mtDNA diversity among a number of beaked whale species indicated that nucleotide diversity was generally lower in this group than in other wide-ranging oceanic cetaceans. The cause of this low diversity was not clear but may be indicative of overall low abundance. Particularly low levels of diversity were found in Baird's beaked whale Berardius bairdii , Arnoux's beaked whale B. arnuxii and the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus. Strong geographic structure in haplotype frequencies was observed among a worldwide sample of Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2002.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/21</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3083930</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1018052</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Their advent has created new settings within which or through which women's roles may become redefined. This thesis explores the questions of how relationships between Samoan language nests and family systems have developed, and how these relationships may have affected the development of roles within Samoan families, especially women's roles.    To obtain answers to these questions three theoretical frameworks were utilised. Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological model provided concepts for understanding the developmental changes occurring in the transitional relationships between families and language nests. The second theoretical perspective employed was Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural framework to analyse the cultural processes developing between Samoan families and language nests. The final framework was provided by Goodnow and Collins's (1990) concept of 'parents ideas'. Their argument is that parents' ideas and style of parenting has been influenced by their own ontogenic development, and by society's expectations.    The answers to the research questions were obtained by interviewing 21 Samoan language nest supervisors in the Auckland area and 100 caregivers or parents. Samoan language nests influenced parents, mothers and their families in their awareness and affirmation of Samoan language and culture, helping with parenting skills, provided support groups and served as an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills about preschool operation and educational processes. Language nests reinforced women's maternal roles, it changed the way they related to their children and the women's support groups encouraged women to assert their rights as women. The level of commitment by women is illustrated in the ways mothers and parents contributed at the language nests. Overall 92 percent of the mothers and parents helped at the nests.    The significant contribution of women in Samoan language nests serve to affirm her as a 'poutu', the 'superwoman', the strength of her family, of the church and her community.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/22</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9836848</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA838827</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

They are the age group most likely to feature in public health statistics, especially those of intentional and unintentional injury. A common risk factor cited in these statistics is conflict within or breakdown of an inter-personal relationship, in particular intimate heterosexual relationships. Intimate relationships serve as markers of normal adulthood in New Zealand society, and many young people invest significantly in them for their emotional and material rewards. This study investigated the social processes and experiences that influence young adult New Zealanders' perceptions of their own and others' intimate relationships. It employed an inter-disciplinary framework of critical interpretive medical anthropology and a public health approach with a lifecourse perspective. A multi-interview method was used involving more than 90 people interviewed either in focus groups, as couples, or as individuals. Interviews focused on young people's ideas and experiences of healthy and unhealthy relationships, as well as the influence of families, friends, and popular culture on relationships.    Intimate relationships are based on naturalised gender differences that work to construct men as masculine/active and women as feminine/passive and hide disparities based on gender within a discourse of equality. The ideal healthy relationship is based on ideas of individualism, emotional and material inter-dependence, and the addition of other social networks into a partner relationship. Families are primary sources of information about and models for relationships. Friends are significant in establishing an adult identity separate to one's parents. Both families and friends are emotional safety nets in times of relationship difficulties. Understandings of popular culture and its products are most commonly experienced through gendered romantic narratives. Because of their ubiquity and popularity, information produced by mass media is particularly influential for young people.    Overall, young people reported that relationships are a considerable source of joy to them. However, when problems occur, they tend to revert to stereotypical and gendered cultural scripts rather than relying on individual knowledge. To mitigate the possible negative effects of these scripts, knowledge of the skills required to overcome relationships difficulties need to be made explicit and fostered by relevant public health and education policy and promotion activities.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/24</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3139241</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1241150</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

A substantial body of research now exists investigating the effects of different task types and their accompanying instructions on learning. Less is known about how tasks affect intake and the relationship between intake and acquisition.
This study investigated the effects of 1) implicit and explicit inductive instructions and 2) various task types on both intake and acquisition of two English grammatical structures. Fifty adult ESL learners enrolled in private language schools in New Zealand were pretested with the help of a timed and an untimed grammaticality judgement test for prior knowledge of negative adverbs and adverb placement and were randomly assigned to either a dictation, an individual reconstruction, or a collaborative reconstruction treatment. Treatments were accompanied by either implicit instructions (containing only practical instructions on how to perform the task) or explicit instructions (drawing participants' attention to the target structures and giving an example of them). Performance on the treatments was taken as a measure of intake, and talk-aloud reports were obtained to gauge participants' awareness during task completion. Gain scores from pretest to posttest and to delayed posttest were taken as an indication of learning effects.
The results show that the explicit instructions of the inductive type used in this study were unable to affect participants' intake and acquisition in comparison with the implicit instructions. Also, the three types of treatments did not have an effect on acquisition in many cases. Where there was an effect, the treatments differentially affected intake and acquisition. Dictation led to high intake, but less acquisition, and the individual reconstruction treatment led to low intake, but greater acquisition. The collaborative reconstruction treatment was the most consistent of the three. The cognitively more demanding reconstruction treatments (i.e. those involving the retention of larger amounts of texts over longer periods of time) resulted in greater acquisition than the dictation treatment.
The main theoretical implications of the results are that the type of inductive and low-level explicit instructions used in this study were not sufficient to differentially affect intake and acquisition. Other, more explicit types of treatments may be necessary. The results also indicate that task types that are relatively easy, affect intake to a greater extent than more demanding tasks, but that more demanding tasks are more likely to affect acquisition.
On a methodological level, the concept of intake was found to be very difficult to operationalise, and it is suggested that additional measures be developed. Finally, the implications for teaching practice are that for relatively complex structures such as negative adverbs and adverb placement exposure to the input with minimal pedagogic intervention may not be sufficient. Teachers may also want to consider the effects of different task types on both intake and acquisition and both teachers and researchers need to be careful in drawing conclusionson the basis of immediate task performance.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Applied Language Studies and Linguistics)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/25</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1564291</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Methodology involved functional and manufacturing replication experiments and comparisons of these results with statistics derived from the analysis of almost 12,000 archaeological adzes. Methodology was guided by technological organization theory which states that technological strategies reflect human behaviours and that artefacts like adzes are physical manifestations of the strategies employed by people to overcome problems posed by environmental and resource conditions. Variability in adze morphology was discovered to be the outcome of ongoing technological adjustments to a range of conditions that were constrained by a set of functionally defined parameters. The nature of the raw material, both for the adzes themselves and to make them, had a major influence on adze technology and morphology within these functional parameters. Four basic functional adze types were identified fi-om distinct and consistent combinations of design attributes not previously recognized explicitly in previous adze typologies. It was found that design attributes previously considered significant like crosssection shape and butt reduction were more heavily influenced by raw material quality than functional specifications. It was also important to recognize that form and function changed over time with use, and because adzes were so valuable due to manufacturing costs, they were intensively curated. The majority of archaeological specimens studied for this thesis had seen major morphological and functional change. This dynamic was included ,in a typology based on 'adze state7 as findings suggested (1) that extending adze use-life and optimizing reworking potential was incorporated in initial design strategies, (2) that intensive curation may have played a major role in changes in adze morphology over time, and (3). that it had a major influence on distribution and discard patterns in the archaeological record. Having identified these influences on adze discard and distribution, two complex production and distribution networks were observed for the North Island based around Tahanga basalt and Nelson~Marlborough argillite. Each was complimentary to the other and involved other major and minor products and materials. Influential factors in the roles different settlements played in distribution included where people and raw materials were in relation to one another and the mode of transportation. The coastal location of early period settlements and important stone sources was an important aspect of these networks.</dc:description><dc:description>Images in this PhD thesis are available from http://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/6122</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/26</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA969867</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

vegetation pattern and to identify the factors which have influenced the development of this
pattern.
Information about the order and dates of eruptive events was reviewed to gauge the length of
time that the various surfaces of the island have been available as a substrate for the
development of a vegetation covering. Available geological information, dating evidence,
historical accounts, tree ages, and Maori evidence all point to a single period of eruptive
activity, probably only several years in duration, around the mid- to late-1300's (A.D.). The
order of eruption was probably production of the ash that covers neighbouring islands,
followed by cinder cone building, followed by eruption of the lava flows.
The lava flows were found to consist of clinkery aa flows, blocky aa flows, and a flow type
referred to as Rangitoto slab flows. These flow types could be partially distinguished from
one another, using discriminant analysis, on the basis of the length of the longest fragment on
a 5x5m plot and the number of fragments on a lxlm subplot. A new transition sequence of
flow types from pahoehoe to aa lavas is proposed for viscous lavas undergoing low rates of
shear strain.
The vegetation pattern of the lava fields was examine using TWINSPAN and CANOCO
analysis of foliage cover percentage information gathered from 125 5x5m plots. It was found
to consist of a successional sequence of vegetation arranged in a mosaic. The mosaic was
found to relate strictly to the underlying lava flow surface. Large Metrosideros grow in
crevices on slab flows and next to large boulders on aa flows. Smaller Metrosideros grow on
small slabs on slab flows. Mixed species scrub is found growing on unbroken slab surfaces.
The relative rate of colonisation of different types of flows under different climatic conditions
was considered.
The Metrosideros hybrid swarm was studied using morphometric information. The putative
parent species of the swarm were found, using Principal Components Analysis, to be
Metrosideros excelsa and Metrosideros robusta. The Rangitoto Metrosideros population was
found, using Canonical Variates Analysis, to be the result of hybridisation, followed by
introgression towards M. excelsa . The probable F1 hybrids grow in early successional stage
vegetation. The major geographical trend is the tendency for backcrossed hybrids to grow on
the eastern side of the island, suggesting eastern origins of M. robusta seeds.
The impact of browsing animals on the vegetation was studied over five years in exclosures
and corresponding control sites. Metrosideros foliage recovered slightly. Griselinia lucida and
Cyathodes juniperina seedlings were recruited into the shrub layers in exclosures, but not in
control sites. Astelia seedlings also benefitted from the absence of browsing pressure, as did
Thelymitra longifolia.
The distribution of browsing animal populations in relation to the vegetation pattern was
studied using faecal pellet recruitment data gathered by the New Zealand Forest Service in
1984. Both wallabies (Petrogale penicillata penicillata) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were
found to be distributed principally according to the amount of palatable foliage available to
each species in each vegetation type.</dc:description><dc:description>Appendices restricted at the request of the author</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Neil Mitchell</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1992.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/27</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA508569</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Groups of teachers who had uniformly high or low expectations for their students were identified, and their instructional practices, beliefs and effects on the academic and social outcomes for their students were explored in four studies. Study One explored the academic outcomes for students in the high and low expectation teachers' classrooms over a year. Students in the classes of teachers with uniformly high expectations for their students made significantly greater progress in reading than their counterparts in the classes of teachers who had low expectations for their students. Study Two involved observations of the instructional and interactional practices of the different groups of teachers. Those with high expectations for all their students spent more time instructing their students, more frequently provided their students with a framework for their learning, questioned their students more and provided them with more feedback on their learning than the teachers who had uniformly low expectations. It also appeared from the observational data that the teachers who had uniformly high expectations for their students' learning provided a more positive socioemotional climate in which instruction took place. In Study Three the different groups of teachers were interviewed regarding their beliefs about how learning should be provided to students with high or low ability. It was found that the high expectation teachers believed there should be less differentiation in the learning opportunities provided to their low and high ability students than did the low expectation teachers. The former group of teachers also reported providing their students with more choice in their learning than did the latter group of teachers. Study Four focused on the academic and social self-perceptions of the students. The academic self-perceptions of the students who were in the classes with teachers who had high iii expectations for their learning increased across the school year while those in classrooms with teachers who had low expectations for their learning decreased. A model is built whereby it is suggested that teachers' expectations for their classes can have major effects on opportunities to learn, instructional practices, interactional patterns, student self-perceptions and academic outcomes.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor John Hattie</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Michael Townsend</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Richard Hamilton</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Educational Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/28</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3129406</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1207968</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

However, the opinions on what it is and what impact it makes on national systems are still as diverse and divided as ever. This research is an endeavour to contribute further to the understanding of the processes and outcomes of globalisation by undertaking a cross-national historical study of four university systems and four elite universities over an extended period of time. By comparing and juxtaposing the changes in university objectives, provision, funding and regulation between 1946 and 1996, it seeks to establish whether globalisation has reduced national variations and led to convergence in university policies and practices.    This research is structured in three parts. Part I incorporates three chapters: one on the analysis of globalisation and its driving forces; one on the concept of convergence and its manifestations in higher education; and one on the methodology of research. These three chapters together advance an understanding of the mechanisms constituting the convergence hypothesis and its investigation. Part II is comprised of four case studies which provide empirical evidence on the impact of globalisation and the investigation of the hypothesis. Part III provides an integrated analysis of the outcomes as well as a final appraisal of the study itself.    Findings show that global forces do have a strong homogenising tendency causing a high level of convergence across cultures and nations. But convergence is not an inevitable outcome of globalisation. A complicated picture of convergence and divergence is found. It is shown to be possible to have convergence in one aspect of the same policy and divergence in another, as in the examples of female participation and medium of instruction. It is also possible to have convergence among some countries but not others, as in the case of university regulation. The actual result depends on, one, the aspect of policy selected for study; and, two, the dynamic interactions of the following factors: the driving impetus of economic globalisation, the powerful influence of hegemonic states and mighty economic and trade supranational organisations, and the willingness and ability of the nation-states to make the changes. That is to say, the impact of global forces is context-bound. The evidence of both convergence and divergence present at the same time vindicates the complexity and contingent nature of the globalisation process. A more accurate assessment of global effects requires a proper conceptualisation of convergence, the necessary investigation of the global-national-institutional interfaces, and longitudinal comparative studies of different cultures and nations, as illustrated by this study.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/29</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3201548</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1509018</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The development of the New Zealand state from crown colony, to a system of relatively autonomous provincial councils, to a centralized administration took place within a period of four decades. Co-terminous with and essential to the state's progressive securing of its authority was the institutionalization of separate national systems of education for Maori and Pakeha.    Whilst the ascendancy of the state and the securing of education as a central state concern proceeded ultimately with the sanction of the state and in accordance with its objectives it was not a straight forward process in a young nation which was born democratic, but was struggling to consolidate political and cultural unity. The various stages and the ultimate form that education in New Zealand took were closely linked to shifts in the nature and role of the state in its formative years, in the nature of its relationship with civil society, and in its official relationship with Maori. This provided the context and dynamic of the shift to state control as public schooling came to dominate over private or voluntary efforts, and as the particularism of isolated provincial settlements was replaced by a system designed to serve the nation as a whole.    Positing conceptual links between the development of national education and the processes of state formation and nation building in a colonizing context, this thesis argues that the institutionally differentiated form that universal education took in New Zealand produced a site through which socially, culturally and ideologically determined conceptions of “normality” would be legitimated and become hegemonic. By nationalizing education to legitimate a culture of uniformity based on a specific set of norms, individual New Zealanders were differentially created according to class, gender and ethnicity, and to physical, intellectual, behavioural and sensory functioning.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Roger Dale</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2000.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/30</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA917077</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

A multiple-baseline design with an embedded ABAB component was used to compare baseline, 12-15 Hz Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) EEG Biofeedback (“active”) and single-blind sham feedback (“placebo”) conditions. Seven dependent variables including the ADHD Rating Scale, Child Attention Profile, Children's Checking Task, Controlled Oral Word Fluency Test, paired associate learning and continuous performance tasks were combined as z-scores into a single composite repeated measure. Visual and multiple baseline analyses were inconclusive. The primary analysis was by randomisation test with statistical control for overall trend. Randomisation test results were combined across five subjects (two subjects having failed to complete the study) using techniques for combining independent probabilities; for the combined group the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.02) with the active conditions displaying the more improved scores. An examination of effect sizes by subject and condition showed that the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.05, based on the confidence intervals for effect estimates) with a large effect size if trend was ignored and the two “drop-outs” were excluded but non-significant with a small effect size if overall trend was controlled, and the two drop-outs included. Effect sizes calculated pre-post were medium on average, and Reliable Change Indices for CBCL parent rated attention were significant for five subjects (p &lt; 0.001). There was no improvement in academic performance as assessed by pre-post Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised. There was no significant effect of condition on EEG Theta/SMR ratio, although there were some significant correlations with individual dependent variables. Four of six children continued to improve on the composite score from the end of the study to six-month follow-up. Results were discussed in light of non-specific treatment effects such as tacit behavioural training, Fried's respiration hypothesis, the cognitive energetic model of attention and confounds due to trend and subject mortality. It was concluded that EEG biofeedback appears to have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms but these are due largely to non-specific treatment factors and confounds such as regression to the mean.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/33</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3029986</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1010177</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The sample consisted of 33 pervasively hyperactive boys and 34 control children. Parenting and child behaviours, and family life factors were assessed at home using a range of measures including the Parental Account of Children's Symptoms Interview (PACS), the Parenting Scale, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Life Events Questionnaire. In addition, maternal directiveness and synchrony were coded from videotaped parent-child interaction during free play. Children's peer relations were assessed with teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Scale (CBS) and observer ratings of peer interactions at kindergarten.    Results showed that parents of hyperactive boys used less effective parenting skills in disciplinary situations and in coping with child behaviour problems, and spent less time in positive parent-child interaction than comparison group parents. Mothers of hyperactive boys also engaged in fewer synchronous play interactions with their sons and gave more negative ratings on indices of life stress. Poor parent coping, father-child communication, maternal synchrony, negative disciplinary practices, and life stress were significantly associated with hyperactivity after adjusting for the effects of conduct problems. The best parenting predictor of hyperactivity was maternal coping.    Compared with control children, the hyperactive boys received significantly higher ratings on exclusion by peers, aggressive, noncompliant, and non-social behaviours, as well as significantly lower ratings of prosocial behaviour and peer acceptance. These between-group differences in social functioning remained significant after statistical control for the effects of conduct problems. Further analysis suggested that the associations between hyperactivity and child social behaviours were partly or wholly explained by group differences in exposure to parenting behaviours that are important for children's social development.    These findings highlight the need to examine more closely the role of parenting behaviours in shaping the course, prognosis and treatment outcomes in relation to the behavioural and social adjustment of preschool hyperactive children. The implications of these findings for early childhood intervention in hyperactive behaviour problems are discussed.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/34</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3010005</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA957339</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The phenotype of the tremor rat is examined at the genetic, molecular, cellular, neurochemical, physical and behavioural levels, and tremor mutants are described within the context of Canavan disease. Tremor mutants appear to share many phenotypes with both human patients and to the knock-out mouse model. The deletion of aspartoacylase results in a total loss of the capacity to metabolize N-acetyl-aspartate to acetate and aspartate in brain, leading to elevations in brain N-acetyl-aspartate levels, changes in cell and tissue morphology, and physical and behavioural deficits including mild akinesia and loss of normal motor coordination and balance. Parallel to this work was the development of a gene transfer approach to treat Canavan disease, involving Adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of aspartoacylase to the mammalian central nervous system. Gene transfer was undertaken in tremor rat mutants, and analysis was made of gene expression and function as well as the effect of aspartoacylase expression on improving the phenotypic deficits observed in mutant animals. Gene expression was observed at the RNA and protein level, with recombinant protein observed in cell soma and processes. Although not significant the data suggested a trend of decreased NAA levels after aspartoacylase transfer in comparison to animals injected with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein. Improvement was noted in the rotorod phenotype with mutant animals receiving aspartoacylase gene transfer performing better at tests of balance and coordinated locomotion than animals receiving a control vector. The study provided evidence that Adeno-associated virus mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer to the brain improves some of the deficits in tremor mutants, and supports the rationale of human gene transfer for Canavan disease.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Molecular Medicine)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/35</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3136372</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1227935</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Additionally, previous studies have been confined to a rather small set of speech acts, under-researching such face-damaging acts as criticizing and responding to criticism even though these may be more challenging for L2 learners.    The present study examines pragmatic development in the use of criticizing and responding to criticism by a group of Vietnamese EFL learners with a view to shedding light on the pragmatic properties of these speech acts. IL data were collected from 12 high beginners, 12 intermediate learners, and 12 advanced learners, via a written questionnaire and role play, and analyzed with reference to L1 and L2 baseline data collected from 12 Vietnamese and 12 Australian NSs via the same methods. Metapragmatic data were collected via retrospective interview.    Four main findings are discussed. Firstly, the learners criticized and responded to criticism very differently from the NSs. This difference might have adversely affected how the learners negotiated their intentions expressed via speech act realizations. Secondly, there was little evidence of any proficiency effect on the learners' use of these two speech acts. This was probably because pragmatic development was limited by the EFL context, as the learners had had insufficient exposure to the target norms. Thirdly, there was evidence of pragmatic transfer in the learners' production. This transfer was affected by the learners' perception of L1-L2 proximity and assumption of L2 reasonableness. Finally, the retrospective interviews with learners suggested four main sources of influence on their pragmatic decision-making: insufficient L2 pragmatic knowledge, transfer of communication and learning, processing difficulty, and learning experience.    The present study lends support to a number of SLA theories, including Bialystoks' processing model and Meisel et al.'s complexification hypothesis. It found that the major challenge for learners in L2 pragmatic acquisition is to gain control over processing. It also found an acquisitional order of modality markers which was dependent upon their structural complexity and the processing demands involved in producing them.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Language Teaching)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/36</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3189280</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1499710</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Although the focus is on high-stakes assessment for qualifications, other factors, which might also facilitate or hinder English teachers' use of ICTs, such as professional development and infrastructural, technical and access issues, are also considered.    The literature review summarises the factors which tend to constrain or encourage teachers' use of ICTs, with a special focus on the considerable constraint placed on secondary teachers by their role in preparing and assessing students for high-stakes qualifications. The literature review also highlights the lack of convincing research into the impact on learning of ICTs but reveals that, in the subject English, there is some evidence of a positive impact when appropriate ICTs are used by well trained teachers in appropriate contexts.    Key NCEA foundation and implementation documents and publicity, achievement standards and assessment activities were analysed to ascertain the degree of official endorsement for the use of ICTs in secondary schools and English programmes in particular. To gauge the perceptions of New Zealand English teachers about the constraints and encouragers of ICTs in their teaching, all NCEA level one English teachers were surveyed. This was followed by face-to-face and online focus groups in which trends revealed in the survey were explored.    Document analysis revealed considerable official optimism that the flexibility and internal assessment of the NCEA would enable teachers to make greater use of ICTs. The achievement standards and supporting assessment activities however, tend to situate ICTs at the margins of English programmes as optional extras which, if used at all, tend to support current practice. The focus groups confirmed survey findings that, although English teachers are significant users of ICTs in their personal and professional lives, although they believe in the educational advantages of ICTs and although they work in schools and departments which support the classroom use of ICTs, they face significant constraints which prevent them making as much use of ICTs as they would like in their teaching. Most significant among these constraints is pressure of course coverage and lack of class time (largely attributable to the need to prepare students for high-stakes assessments). Other constraints include lack of adequate access to ICTs and technical support, and lack of appropriate professional development and time to learn about ICTs.    Based on the literature review and research findings, recommendations are provided for schools, policy makers and researchers. Key among these is the need to acknowledge the profound influence of high-stakes qualifications on secondary schools and teachers and evolve such qualifications to encourage and enable desired innovations. It is recommended that ICTs could be infused into English and eventually, inter-disciplinary programmes, through the creation of innovative, ICT infused achievement standards which could be combined into flexibly structured courses which better meet the needs of twenty first century students. Also recommended are approaches which enable greater access to ICTs for English teachers and methods of professional development which have proved effective with adult learners.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/37</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3201547</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1548763</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Every Ω number is both  computably enumerable and random. In particular, every Ω number is non-computable. In this thesis, we describe a method to compute the exact values of the first 64 successive bits of a natural  Chaitin Omega number.    We first describe a model of computation which has been defined and proved to be a universal Chaitin machine U. We then propose a method (procedure) which combines iterative executions of an algorithm with mathematical analysis to get the exact values of the first successive 64 bits of the corresponding Chaitin ΩU number of U.    This particular defined Chaitin machine U is essentially a register machine and has been implemented in Java. We call it the canonical compressed model (or compressed model) as it allows only ‘canonical’ program strings to be processed in U. Thus, many input strings which are illegal, hence useless, are ignored and never involved in the computational process. In addition, the compressed design shortens the length of all instructions so that relatively short strings now contain somewhat complex programs.    A simulator for U, written in Java, is a primary part of the project. The algorithm is executed iteratively, computing step by step an increasing sequence of rational numbers (in binary) to approximate Ω U. In the n-th step, the algorithm produces four main output files: all halting strings, looping strings, run-time errors, and prefix strings (incomplete programs). In each step, all prefix strings (of the previous step) are read and processed one by one. Each string is extended by 7 bits (ASCII code representations for symbols) to generate new strings that are examined one by one to detect any lexical, syntactic, semantic, or run-time error in each of them. Any of those strings with an error detected is discarded to save storage space and execution time.    We solve the Halting Problem for all programs for U of length less than or equal to 84 bits so we can calculate an increasing sequence of exact approximations converging to ΩU. By means of a mathematical analysis the first successive 64 bits, 0000001000000100000110001000011010001111110010111011101000010000 of the 84 bits are proved to be the exact first bits of ΩU. Actually, more bits can be obtained by this procedure if the disk space is sufficient for it to go on, but this procedure cannot be extended indefinitely.    In order to assure that our computing result is correct, we have proved that all input strings of length less than or equal to 84 executed in  U over 100 steps are not halting programs.*   *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

Erosion-corrosion is a generalised wear phenomenon where the combined effect of each degradation mechanism generates more extensive mass loss than the sum of each mechanism acting independently. Previous research has highlighted several theoretical mechanisms under this generalized process, ranging from the erosion induced breakdown of oxide scales in corrosive environments, through to the development of oxide layers in highly erosive environments. Prior to this current work experimental simulation of these mechanisms has focused on bulk alloy materials with well characterised oxidation responses, under conditions of low temperature, low erodent impact velocity and high erodent flux, conditions which are readily generated within laboratory scale rigs and which tend towards the low impact energy conditions encountered within fluidised bed combustors. Few works have addressed erosion-corrosion under simulated turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent impact velocity and low erodent flux. While comparative trials have been run under such conditions on a purely mass loss basis, little has been presented regarding the microstructural analysis of such degradation, particularly for materials that rely on the industrially relevant, slow growing oxide scales Cr2O3 and Al2O3.  Thermally sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings are routinely applied to combat wear at high temperature due to the high wear resistance imparted by the hard carbide particles and the high temperature oxidation resistant nature of the Cr2O3 oxide formed over both phases. However, most published work characterising the erosion-corrosion response of these coatings has been conducted on a comparative basis by contrasting coatings of various composition ratios, deposited by various techniques, with the response of well characterised bulk materials. Little has been presented on the microstructural mechanism of erosioncorrosion of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, a point highlighted by the limited understanding of the oxidation mechanism of the Cr3C2 phase, the oxidation mechanisms of the combined composite Cr3C2-NiCr and the influence of the coating splat structure on the oxidation response. While the erosion response of thermal spray coatings and bulk cermets is more widely understood, most works have been conducted under milder conditions than used in the current work. In addition previous works have been conducted primarily on assprayed coatings with few works taking into account the effect of heat treatment induced changes in the coating composition and microstructure that occur with extended in-service exposure at elevated temperature.  In addressing the short comings in the current state of knowledge, the aim of this work was to characterise the mechanism of erosion-corrosion of high velocity sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr thermal spray coatings under turbine conditions, incorporating the effect of variation in the composition and carbide distribution with inflight degradation, variations in starting powder morphology, heat treatment, erosion conditions and exposure temperature.  75 Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr) coatings were deposited by Aerospray HVAF, GMA Microjet HVOF, Stellite Jet Kote HVOF and TAFA JP-5000 HVOF spraying under optimised conditions using agglomerated/sintered and blended powders. The prealloyed powder based coatings, characterised in terms of microhardness, porosity content and phase degradation, were found to exceed the average values of coating quality presented in the literature. The blended powder based coating of this work was comparable with the coating attributes presented in the literature for plasma and HVOF coatings based on this powder morphology. Based on these results the coatings were considered representative of those sprayed industrially and therefore the responses of the samples in this work to oxidation and erosion were considered indicative of the response of industrially applied coatings of this composition in service.  Heat treatment trials were conducted on the Aerospray HVAF and Microjet HVOF coatings at 900ºC in air and argon for up to 60 days to simulate the compositional and microstructural development of these coatings under elevated temperature conditions in service. In the prealloyed powder based coatings, rapid carbide precipitation occurred within the first two days in both coatings to reach the steady state composition of 75-80vol%. Minimal in-flight carbide dissolution in the HVAF coating led to preferential carbide precipitation on the retained carbide grains. In the Microjet HVOF coatings, which suffered extensive inflight carbide dissolution, carbide precipitation occurred as fine precipitates in the carbide-free zones, forming large sponge-like agglomerates. With extended exposure Ostwald ripening led to coarsening of the individual carbide grain size and widespread agglomeration of the carbide grains into an extensive three dimensional network after 30 days exposure, with minimal development out to 60 days. Compositionally, heat treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the supersaturated matrix phase Cr content, with the steady state Cr composition of the Microjet HVOF coating exceeding that of the Aerospray HVAF coating based on XRD analysis. Cr3C2 was the only carbide detected with heat treatment. Heat treatment of the blended powder based coating led to sintering of the single phase splats. Diffusion of the carbide elements into the matrix phase splats occurred, allowing fingers and nodules of the carbide to develop into this phase as well as increasing the matrix phase Cr concentration.  Oxidation of Cr3C2 by hot stage XRD analysis at 600ºC, combined with TGA analysis at 600-850ºC, supported the mechanism of stepwise decarburisation prior to Cr2O3 formation, presented as one possible mechanism in the literature. Oxidation of the Cr3C2-NiCr coatings over the range 700-850ºC was dependent on the starting powder morphology and the extent of dissolved carbide in the matrix phase. Oxidation of the as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings was dictated by the matrix phase, the high Cr concentration resulting from carbide dissolution leading to rapid growth of the Cr2O3 phase over the oxidising carbide grains. Growth stresses induced by such overgrowth lead to the formation of interfacial voids over the carbide grains at high temperature. Heat treatment reduced the matrix phase Cr concentration, resulting in the coating phases oxidising independently with a reduced magnitude of lateral matrix based scale growth over the carbide phase. In the blended powder based coating, bulbous Ni oxides dominated the scale topography. With extended exposure a continuous Cr2O3 scale formed below the faster growing Ni oxides, which enabled lateral growth of the scale over the carbide based Cr2O3 scales. Following heat treatment the matrix phase Cr concentration increased, minimising the development of Ni oxides on this phase.  Erosion studies were carried out in a custom built high temperature erosion apparatus. Ambient temperature trials were conducted using Al2O3 erodent at velocities of 150m/s. The as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings exhibited a brittle impact response, which was accentuated in the Microjet HVOF coating by the increased extent of in-flight carbide dissolution and the splat structure which made this sample more susceptible to brittle erosion mechanisms. Heat treatment of these coatings led to sintering of the splats and a more ductile impact response due to the increased ductility of the matrix phase. The as-sprayed blended powder based coatings exhibited a range of impact responses from brittle erosion of the carbide through to ductile erosion of the matrix based splats. Mass loss was accentuated by the poor intersplat adhesive strength. Heat treatment led to sintering of the splats, resulting in a more microstructural based erosion response.  The two prealloyed powder based coatings generated similar erosion rates under the aggressive conditions, distinctly more erosion resistant than the blended powder based coatings. Heat treatment improved the erosion resistance of all the coatings, however, the duration of heat treatment had a negligible effect on the magnitude of erosive mass loss.  Erosion at 800ºC, with an impact velocity of 235m/s, lead to significantly deeper erodent penetration into the coating than noted at ambient temperature. The significant increase in the matrix phase ductility at elevated temperature minimized the impact of carbide dissolution on the matrix impact response in the prealloyed powder based coatings. The primary effect of carbide dissolution was to reduce the carbide concentration, allowing deformation of the matrix to dictate the coating response. Carbide development with heat treatment significantly reduced the ability of the matrix to deform in this manner. The increased matrix phase ductility in the blended powder based coating reduced the concentration of impact energy on the splat boundaries, leading to a more microstructural based erosion response. Heat treatment had a negligible effect on the coating response, given the reduced significance of the splat boundary adhesion.  Erosion at 700ºC generated similar erosion responses in the prealloyed powder based coatings to those noted at 800ºC, the lower matrix phase ductility reflected in the more brittle response evident as brittle cracking and fracture. The effect of carbide development with heat treatment was not as dramatic as at 800ºC due to the reduced matrix phase ductility at this temperature. Erosion of the blended powder based coating at 700ºC generated the same spectrum of erosion response as noted at 800ºC in both the as-sprayed and heat treated states, with the variation in matrix phase ductility with temperature overshadowed by the heterogeneous coating impact response resulting from the heterogeneous phase distribution.  The steady state erosion rate at 700ºC was comparable across all of the coatings in both the as-sprayed and heat treated conditions. At 800ºC, heat treatment had a negative impact on the prealloyed powder based coatings, but no definitive effect on the blended powder based coatings. The Microjet HVOF coatings were more erosion resistant than the Aerospray HVAF coatings under these conditions. These results pointed to a reduction in the significance of the coating splat structure on the magnitude of erosion, in favour of a more microstructural based response at high temperature.  In both the ambient and elevated temperature trials the coating microhardness values proved to be a poor indicator in predicting the magnitude or relative ranking of the erosion response of the different coatings under these aggressive erosion conditions.  Erosion-corrosion under turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent velocity and low erodent flux, was simulated by oxidizing samples at 900ºC and subjecting them to one second of erosion every 48 hours over a period of 60 days. The degradation testing was assessed in accelerated testing in additional trials by polishing the oxide scale formed at 900ºC from the sample surface every 48 hours over the same time period. Under these conditions the coatings formed thick oxide scales that penetrated into the coating. Preferential internal oxidation of the Cr3C2 phase occurred in the coating, consuming the grains in the near surface zone through the formation of Cr2O3 to a depth dependent upon the test temperature. Oxygen ingress occurred along the carbide-matrix interface and was accentuated in the regions of impact damage surrounding the erodent indentations. Internal oxidation of the carbide phase sealed off the pockets of matrix phase which were eventually consumed by oxidation once they were no longer able to maintain a protective Cr2O3 oxide. The extent of internal attack was consistent in the 20, 40 and 60 day samples, suggesting that the internal oxidation front proceeded at a constant rate in front of the erosion front into the coating. The prealloyed powder based coatings were more resistant to such internal degradation relative to the blended powder based coatings, with an internally oxidised zone of 6ìm relative to the 10ìm thick internally oxidized band in the blended powder based coating. While each erodent impact event may be classified as oxidation affected erosion, the low erodent flux effectively led to a long-term response more accurately described as erosion affected oxidation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Chemical and Materials Engineering)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/39</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1584527</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Progressive realization of adverse effects has led to increasing demand for and imposition of control measures. The concept of common law embodied in legal tradition have been found inadequate, and forced a change to "enacted law". The regulatory explosion necessitated delegation from legislative to executive agencies.The resulting techniques of control developed in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States are examined. One common factor stands out, the extensive dependence of law-making bodies on independent technical specification material from non-government sources, and the confused, conflicting, and inconsistent methods of utilizing those specifications in law-making. Most of this independent material comes from Standards bodies. Their basic concept, the establishing of acceptable practice by prior agreement, is outlined, and the growth of the movement traced from the original development in Britain to a World-wide movement. Their processes of consultation and consensus represent a practical democratic system of self regulation. Studies of these aspects are rare, but a number of those relevant are reviewed, ranging from the Robens committee in Britain, through Building Code Reform in New Zealand, to a whole series of very recent reports from the United States, including a Presidential Task Force, an attempt to establish a National Standards Policy, a Federally commissioned study by a Professor of Law, and a Presidential Executive Order.From these emerge the pattern of complaint: Regulatory control is excessive, rigid, and liable to cause economic waste. It tends to be ineffective, and fails to achieve primary aims. As technology development exposes society to greater risks, efficiency becomes more vital, and failure to achieve control a serious danger. Problems arise from the failure of traditional legal approaches to adapt to the newer challenge of technology, particularly the legal acceptance of law "as it is" without recognition that the task calls for developing the law-making process to meet the needs of the changed situation. It is contended that many of the problems in regulatory control of technology come from the practice of making technical specification material direct legal command. The various reports reviewed comment on the limitations inherent in negative legislative control, the irrelevance of litigation, Court action and punishment, to the fundamental problem of achieving successful control. There is need for the encouragement of self regulation, and establishment of appropriate links with law.The special characteristics and responsibilities of law controlling technology are brought out, and call for identification as a separate branch of law: "Technological Law". Such law, it is contended, needs to make optimum usage of (a) the factors that have contributed to the dominance of technology, including the scientific approach, and the practice of prior agreement and (b) the essential components of democratic society, including participation, consensus, decentralized control, and self regulation associated with a formal method of determining acceptability.Practical proposals are developed involving the recognition of the practice of legislating by reference to independent technical specifications the encouragement of self-regulation processes through statutory backing, and their linking by recognition of the dyad in law, a separation of fundamental aims and principles appropriate to law from the means of meeting these aims.There is detailed examination of the three themes of reform. Techniques of the reference process, the legal objections, and the range of practices are examined, and acceptable technique suggested. The significance and importance of self-regulation is examined, and the contribution of "Standards" developed. A detailed examination is made of the various examples of two part law found in legislation, or in the studies reviewed. The framing of law in terms of general requirements is considered in relation to the problem of certainty and the idealization of the performance concept. The prerogative of the law-maker to designate certain practices as complying with general requirements is established as fundamental. The objection that this is a function of interpretation which lies exclusively with the Courts is discussed and the principle advanced that the vital Court function should never be called into the routine observance area.Technological law has as its essential aim the achievement of observance. Punishment, and court action is indication of failure. The emphasis must be on understanding and facilitating compliance. The second part of the dyad calls for sets of interrelated, interdependent specifications of acceptable practice, serving equally differing specialized laws, technical practices, commercial practices and education, and clarifying in positive fashion that which complies with law. The existing, established mechanisms of the world Standards movement are seen as providing the sets of technical specifications to fulfill this second function. This industry-developed process of self regulation utilises the techniques of prior agreement and in practical form, the elusive concept of consensus.Studies have emphasised the superior ability of the system to call in technical resources and voluntary effort to the service of law-making, in comparison with the resources of a governmental agency. The desirable aim is partnership, and the utilization of substantial measures of voluntary compliance.The question of recognition and authority for Standards and their producing organizations is seen as essential, and criteria are developed from the examples reviewed, notably from the pioneer New Zealand Act of 1941.The study emphasizes the little recognised function of Standards organizations of identifying acceptable practice, providing what has become an essential component of the machinery of government of a modern state.The mechanism provides a basis of certainty for commercial operations, and, through the strength of consumer or purchaser choice, an effective method of control as an alternative to yet more complex regulatory activity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor R.F.l.Teyer</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>1978</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1979.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/40</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA741390</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

This has been grounded in the local realities of Auckland as a representative modern/postmodern city.    Global discussion among urban missions strategists and theologians have provoked the question: 'What is the relationship of the Spirit of Christ to the transformation of a postmodern city?' This has been examined in a limited manner, using two local indicators: the New Zealand revival (for the work of the Holy Spirit) and Auckland city (for emergent modern/postmodern megacities). This has resulted in an exploration of  revival theology and its limitations among Auckland's Pentecostals and Evangelicals and a proposal for a theology of transformative revival that engages the postmodern city.    To accomplish this, a research framework is proposed within an evangelical perspective, a postmodern hermeneutic of 'transformational conversations ', an interfacing of faith community conversations and urban conversations.    This is used to develop a new theory of 'citywide transformative revival' as an expansion of revival theories, a field within pneumatology. Citywide transformative revival is a concept of synergistic revivals in multiple sectors of a mega-city. This results in long-term change of urban vision and values towards the principles of the Kingdom of God.    A theology of transformative process is developed from apostolic and prophetic themes. These are outcomes of gifts released in revival. Transformative revival results in new transformative apostolic and prophetic structures that engage the postmodern city soul.    Transformation implies goals. The results of revival, the transformative visions for the city, are developed from themes of the City of God and the Kingdom of God. I expand largely 'spiritual' Western formulations of the Kingdom to a holistic Kingdom vision of the spiritual, communal and material aspects of the postmodern city. These enable conversation spaces with modern urbanism and postmodernism.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Theology)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/41</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3200294</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1560284</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

through two larger courses and one individual study program. A different
teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each
course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the
students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research
on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults.
Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods
included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as
well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather
more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the
individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of
the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences
with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex
overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure
had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways
in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts.
The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the
courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving
groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The
lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when
they started,
Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the
nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs
about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the
teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics
and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach
trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six
months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that
mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The
second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful
students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life.
Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured
reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the
mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Mathematics Education)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1582095</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Part One summarises theories about leadership and places principals' educational leadership in context. Leadership is defined as a social process whereby principals blend biography and context to reconcile positivist, systemic requirements and recommendations with appropriate localised, and individualised, expectations and aspirations.    Part Two outlines an ethnographic methodology that justifies a process to gather and analyse data on the work of three principal subjects. This material is presented in cameo form and supported by questionnaire data from a further group of principal colleagues. Principals' leadership is identified as the interpretation of expectations and resources that results in particular actions. This interpretation is sourced in both context and personal biography.    Part Three consists of data analysis and findings. The influence and interplay of context and personal biography are outlined. Conclusions are drawn as to the differences between leadership and management practices, and specific leadership activities performed by principals are identified. This leads to a clarification of leadership as a process of control (as opposed to power) that defines, rather than accommodates, the rules of realisation as to appropriate action. Recommendations are made regarding further study into the issues of personal identity, leadership style and the urgent need for principal pre-service and in-service professional development.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (EdD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/43</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3061138</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1036402</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Between 1942 and 1948 servicemen returning from theatres of war in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific brought over 3000 wives and 700 fiancées to New Zealand. Portrayed as homogeneous, young, working-class British housewives who made hasty ill-considered marriages, war brides, in fact, proved to be varied in origin, age, occupation and education. Whirlwind romances and short courtships were not the norm. This thesis examines the consequences of the decision to marry a New Zealander and migrate and the impact of the journey and settlement. The full glare of publicity that greeted war brides on arrival focused attention on their compatibility with, and adaptability to, the receiving society. Adjustment was however fraught with difficulties.    Memory and loss are implicit in the experience of migration. War brides expressed this in terms of the rift with their pasts and a lack of shared memories. On arrival in New Zealand war brides dispersed around the country in an extreme 'pepper-potting' pattern. When their only connection with New Zealand was their locally-born husband they suffered social isolation and sometimes a devastating sense of loneliness. The resulting marginalisation they experienced was evident in their oral history narratives. Ambivalence and recourse to serendipity as an explanation for past actions were elements of the dis-composure discernable in narratives.    In spite of their varied religious, social and class backgrounds, this diverse cohort formed a war bride identity based on shared experience rather than national or ethnic origin. Far from dissipating, their war-bride identity has been consolidated into an enduring image most tangibly expressed in the extant war brides' clubs, although club attendance is not a prerequisite of war bride identity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--History)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/44</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3201550</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1509222</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Little is known about the ethnic socialisation of internationally adopted children, raised in racially similar adoptive homes. Within the TRA literature, it has been found that transracially adopted children tend to ethnically identify with the white majority culture. That tendency has also been linked to adoptive parents' attitudes about the birth culture, and speculation that most parents are assimilating their children to the dominant culture. Research on TRA has also revealed that despite low ethnic identification, most adoptees score highly on indices of self-concept.    In the present study, 162 New Zealand adoptive families of European descent, with children adopted predominately from Eastern Europe, were surveyed concerning their experiences and attitudes about the importance of their children's birth culture. Results from the surveys showed that the majority of families engaged in a range of cultural activities, and made efforts to socialise with people of their child's birth ethnicity. In addition, most of the adoptive parents expressed a desire that their children ethnically identify with the birth culture, as well as with the New Zealand culture. Almost all of the families researched the birth country before travelling to collect their children, and most parents kept part or all of their child's original name.    A sub-sample of 52 of the adopted children was also interviewed in a second phase of the study. Measures of ethnic identity were obtained, using the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), as were adjustment scores, using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (Piers, 1984). Findings revealed that overall, the children had moderate identification with the birth culture, and moderate to high self-concept scores, which were not correlated with one another other.    From the parent surveys, a scale was derived to assess the parent's sensitivity to culture. Known as the 'Cultural Sensitivity Measure' (CSM), this score was statistically compared to the children's ethnic identity scores, to test the assumption that the parents' attitudes about the birth culture would influence the children's ethnic identification with the birth culture. While the parents had moderate sensitivity scores, no relationship was found between the parents CSM scores and the children's MEIM scores.    Overall, these findings suggest that the internationally adopted children in New Zealand are well adjusted, interested in their ethnic origins, and being parented by New Zealanders who support the children's interest in their birth culture. Future areas of research were identified, and recommendations to families, professionals and policymakers were offered.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Nikki Harre</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/45</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3214157</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1566603</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

However, relatively little is known about this risk.    This research expands the body of knowledge of ICRE investment risk by producing conclusions about the information content of prices and the distribution of returns in the ICRE context. It is broken into three main parts.    First, the ICRE returns-generating process is characterised to form a basis for deducing theoretical conclusions about the information content of prices and the stochastic attributes of returns. The rationale for this approach lies in capital markets literature, which demonstrates that the characteristics of the information structure of markets, the decision-making processes of investors and the market trading mechanism determine the main attributes of the process of price evolution (which is assumed to be the main driver of returns). The analysis concludes that ICRE prices are partially informed, and changes in prices are described by a ‘jump’ process.    Second, analysis of a database of ‘large’ price changes supplied by the Property Council of Australia is undertaken to empirically test the jump process hypothesis. This analysis provides evidence that natural events associated with changes in the leasing structure of properties are a primary driver of relatively large, infrequent dislocations in valuation-based prices.    With parts one and two as a backdrop, the third part of this research empirically tests a discrete mixture of normals (‘DMON’) model of investment risk. Capital markets research shows that a DMON model flows naturally from jump price processes. DMON models fitted to cross-sectional returns on individual properties supplied by the PCA are found to be superior to the normal and stable Paretian models previously proposed by other researchers.    In aggregate these conclusions have serious implications for the management of ICRE portfolios, and suggest a need for additional research. Some implications include: (1) Mean-lower partial variance is superior to mean-variance optimisation. (2) Forecasting the distribution of ICRE returns forms a new tool for active management. (3) Passive portfolio management is inappropriate. (4) Comparables-based valuations may be unreliable for investment decisions.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Gerald R.

The study stresses the importance of valuing the language and culture of students in Aotearoa-New Zealand for whom English is another language. It is argued that the discourse of what shall be called ‘technocratic pedagogy’ falls short of meeting this goal. What is needed is more expansive and inclusive programmes that apprehend the social, economic, and political contexts of learning. This is necessary if the students are to continue their education not simply to absorb prescribed information and ideas but to actively understand, question, challenge, and change the school and the classroom.    The thesis is written from the perspective of an indigenous Maori teacher trained in technocratic approaches of practice looking to aspects of her intimate culture, Tongan and Samoan ways of representing the world, and Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy to transform contemporary education that tends to exclude the adolescents from learning in school. This thesis is not simply another contribution to the ways in which teachers of school English in general think about methodologies and approaches to learning; rather, it is addressed more specifically to those Maori, Tongan, and Samoan teachers in this country who work with and alongside communities who are from the Kingdom of Tonga and the islands of Samoa. Thus, there is great value placed on educational experience with indigenous Tongan and Samoan teachers and students in an educational project referred to in the thesis as a ‘School-within-a-school’. The School-within-a-school refers to a site of education for teaching school English to immigrant adolescents within a large, state, secondary school in the city of Auckland. Particular attention is also paid to educational experience with indigenous teachers in a Curriculum Committee and Maori and Tongan grassroots organisations located within the same school.    A fresh approach to teaching English accepts culture as the ground on which to begin to reflect on a practice within a specific context. The teachers who have a dynamic relationship with students argue that culture is a primary site for contradictions and that a revolutionary challenge to technocratic pedagogy is necessary, but not sufficient, to value and actively include the students in school. Since the English language and its attendant practices, values, traditions, and aspirations are the grounds for the students' marginalisation, immediate, consciously organised changes in the teaching beliefs, contents of education, and society at large in Aotearoa are necessary parts of any reintegrative pedagogy.    On this account, the belief is that pedagogy is vitally important since it can enable the students to understand the technocratic discourse and draw upon the personal and collective experiences to counter the tendency that denies them full participation in school and the classroom.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/47</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3046046</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1018358</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The history of theorising about ornament bears evidence to this as much as do current practices of ornamentation. From myths, as narratives of meaning, to ‘mere ornament’ – the various signifying practices (and forms of life within which they take place) determine how meaning changes. People will perceive such change differently, depending on their perspectives and circumstances and, under certain conditions, change can be conceived of as loss. This thesis, in its theoretical part, explores issues pertaining to meaning and ornament in epistemology, philosophy, sociology, semiotics, aesthetics and psychoanalysis. In its practical part it seeks to make connections with signifying practices involving ornament in the life-worlds of users, the use of ornament in public buildings, bicultural relationships involving appropriation or misappropriation, and the education of designers in New Zealand. For that, data derived from four empirical research projects are presented and theorised. In the fourth part, theories and practices are brought together to shed light on struggles with ornamental meaning in the past and in the present. Theories, with their classification of myths, symbols and ornament, ignore wide ranges of signifying practices and privilege some form of significations at the expense of others. Because of their separation from the language- games and forms of life of ornamental practice, they often fail to grasp issues that are important to non-theorists. All the research projects demonstrated that the large majority of participants like and relate to ornament. They also showed, however, that Pakeha traditions of ornament are not only perceived to have suffered the same historical rupture as those in the West but also that the theoretical discreditation upon which they were based was used as a tool of oppression when applied to Maori art. Attempts to explain bicultural practices of appropriation or misappropriation without reference to the history of colonisation and present power configurations must fail. Whether or not a cultural image retains or loses its meaning depends on factors such as knowledge, understanding, relationality and co-operation. If culture is, however, treated as a resource for commodification – as it is by the culture industries – cultural elements are subjected to rules inherent in marketing and capitalist economies and their meaning is deliberately changed. Those who ought to be able to deal competently with these issues (designers and other cultural intermediaries) receive little in their education to prepare them for the ornamental strategies and tactics of their future clients. The academic environment is still largely determined by modernist agendas, and ornament as a topic and as practice – continues to be repressed. If a meaningful ornamental language and practice relevant to Aotearoa is to be shared, created, and sustained the divisions between theory and the life-world need to be interrogated; the distance through an assumed superiority of Pakeha to Maori history, culture and people relinquished; and a type of conversation must commence that takes seriously the Treaty of Waitangi as the founding document of this country. The partnership concept of this document facilitates conversation about differential positions and rules and can ‘take us out of our old selves by the power of strangeness, to aid us in becoming new beings’ (Rorty, 1980: 289).</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Michael Peters</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Len Bell</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education and Art History)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/48</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3029985</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA974239</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

A model of root hair population structure was developed and validated that will facilitate research on root hairs of these species.    Diagrams were drawn of the root hair length and frequency on entire root systems. The distributions of root hairs on these diagrams often differed from textbook diagrams of root hairs because root hair length and frequency varied considerably along the root axis.    The key issue examined was the response at species, population and genotype levels of root hair populations perturbed by aluminium and phosphate, and the implications of these responses for our understanding of the strategies adopted by plants growing in stressful environments.    Demographic growth analysis gave the best understanding of the mechanisms of root hair population response to genetic variability, resource depletion and environmental perturbation. Root hair length seemed to be controlled by the individual root hair. However the number of root hairs appeared to be controlled by the root. Therefore it is the root that controls the distribution of the hairs on the root, and how this distribution is modified by perturbation.    Root hair populations were shown to have strategies that were similar to their shoot system growth strategies-guerrilla for clover, phalangeal for ryegrass. The root and root hair systems, and shoot systems also demonstrated similar characteristics when the r and K strategy model was applied. At an ecosystem level, clover and ryegrass occupied the same orthogonal in the CSR (competitive-stress-ruderal) model. Therefore at a larger scale, these plants are able to coexist, but they do this by having different strategies at a species level.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Botany (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1999.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/50</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9940677</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA888521</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Data on anthropometric variation of six Solomon Island populations is analyzed using statistical models which can distinguish between within-group and between-group genetic variation.    The correlation structure of 27 anthropometric measurements is examined by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. The six populations show a common pattern (in both males and females) which echoes earlier studies. The correlation matrix of measurements is then partitioned into genetic and environmental components and the genetic correlation matrix is examined, once again by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. There is a fairly close agreement between the genetic correlation structure and the phenotypic correlation structure. The environmental correlation matrix is not examined further because it is very poorly estimated.    The partitioning of phenotypic correlations into genetic and environmental components is based on a multivariate generalization of a path model for the heritability of a continuous trait proposed by C. C. Li. The parameters estimated in the single trait model include additive genetic heritability, common home environment, and genetic correlation between spouses. In order to fit this model observations are required on parent-offspring, spouse-spouse, and sib-sib correlations. Heritability values for the Solomons are markedly lower than those reported elsewhere. However, when total heritability (ignoring subpopulation structure) is estimated for the six Solomons populations, the values are higher and form a more familiar pattern. The striking differences between the two kinds of heritability in the Solomon Islands emphasizes the danger of using total heritability estimates obtained from several subpopulations or a national sample.    The between-group component of heritability for each measurement is compared to the within-group heritability and to levels of between-group phenotypic variation. The results demonstrate that high within-group heritability for a given trait does not imply that between-group variation in that trait is genetic in origin.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>1983</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1982.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/51</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/8323923</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA219303</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The intention of Section One, 'Biographical Texts: Theoretical Underpinning', is to explore and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of Maori feminism and Kaupapa Maori as they relate to biography as a research method into the lives of Maori women. Biography, as a literary genre is also examined with particular reference to feminist, women of colour and Maori biography. Section One is a wideranging section, encompassing a broad sweep of the literature in these areas. It both draws from existing literature and contributes to the discourse regarding Maori feminism, Maori biography and Maori research. It is relevant to but unconstrained by the content of Section Two. The intention of Section Two, 'Locating the Story of Betty Wark; A Biographical Narrative with Reflective Annotations', is to provide an example of the biographical method and what might constitute Maori biography. The subject of the biographical narrative, Betty Wark, was a Maori woman who was actively involved with community-based organisations from the 1950s until her death in May 2001. Several major themes which emerged from Betty's biographical history occur throughout her narrative and provide a framework in which her story is located. One of the most significant themes was the notion of 'home'; both literal and metaphorical. This theme is reflected in the title of the thesis, Writing Ourselves 'Home'.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Women's Studies)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/53</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1665397</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Asymptotic stability of these models contradicts observations. In this thesis we consider some factors which were suggested as able to destabilise the system. We consider discrete-time and continuous-time autonomous epidemiological models. We try to keep our models as simple as possible and investigate the impact of different factors on the system behaviour. Global methods of dynamical systems theory, especially the theory of bifurcations and the direct Lyapunov method are the main tools of our analysis.    Lyapunov functions for a range of classical epidemiological models are introduced. The direct Lyapunov method allows us to establish their boundedness and asymptotic stability. It also helps investigate the impact of such factors as susceptibles' mortality, horizontal and vertical transmission and immunity failure on the global behaviour of the system. The Lyapunov functions appear to be useful for more complicated epidemiological models as well.    The impact of mass vaccination on the system is also considered. The discrete-time model introduced here enables us to solve a practical problem-to estimate the rate of immunity failure for pertussis in New Zealand.    It has been suggested by a number of authors that a non-linear dependence of disease transmission on the numbers of infectives and susceptibles can reverse the stability of the system. However it is shown in this thesis that under biologically plausible constraints the non-linear transmission is unable to destabilise the system. The main constraint is a condition that disease transmission must be a concave function with respect to the number of infectives. This result is valid for both the discrete-time and the continuous-time models.    We also consider the impact of mortality associated with a disease. This factor has never before been considered systematically. We indicate mechanisms through which the disease-induced mortality can affect the system and show that the disease-induced mortality is a destabilising factor and is able to reverse the system stability. However the critical level of mortality which is necessary to reverse the system stability exceeds the mortality expectation for the majority of human infections. Nevertheless the disease-induced mortality is an important factor for understanding animal diseases.    It appears that in the case of autonomous systems there is no single factor able to cause the recurrent outbreaks of epidemics of such magnitudes as have been observed. It is most likely that in reality they are caused by a combination of factors.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Supervisor Dr W J Walker</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/54</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3015611</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA972143</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Specifically, it compared the effects of timing of correction (immediate versus delayed correction) and manner of correction (explicit versus implicit correction). It also investigated the relative effects of correction of morphological versus syntactic features and correction of developmental early versus developmental late features. Data for the study were collected from 56 intermediate level students of English as a Foreign Language in Iranian university and private language school settings. Each participant was required to read and then retell a written text in their own words during an oral interview with the researcher. During or following the interview the researcher corrected the participants on their grammatical errors implicitly (using recasts) or explicitly (providing metalinguistic information). Individualised tests focusing on the errors that had been corrected were constructed for each participant and administered. Statistical analyses were conducted on the scores the participants received on their individualised tests. Results showed no significant differences for timing of correction. However, significant differences were found for manner of correction. Participants who received explicit correction gained significantly higher scores than those who received implicit correction. This finding lends support to the argument of Schmidt (1994) concerning the role of metalinguistic awareness in language acquisition. Correction of morphological features was found to be more effective than that of syntactic features. It is argued that morphological features are generally learnt as items whereas syntactic features involve system learning. Correction of developmental early features was found to be more effective than correction of developmental late features. This finding lends support to suggestions that corrective feedback (like other types of form-focused instruction) needs to take into account learners' cognitive readiness to acquire features (Pienemann 1984; Mackey 1999). iii Analyses of the interactions between independent variables were also conducted. It was found that explicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental early features and implicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental late features The implications of these results for both second language acquisition and language pedagogy are considered.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr. Helen Basturkmen</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Professor Rod Ellis</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Language Learning and Teaching)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/55</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1595764</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

New Zealand's relative isolation, sparse population, short history and colonial past have all contributed to a heightened national awareness of, and sensitivity to, its cultural condition. This study aims to explore, with an analyst's eye and ear, notions of national style through a group of orchestral works. Contemporary critical musicology, which flourished in the 1990s, typically integrates various frames of reference and suggests that analysis be framed in the broader cultural context of a work's genesis and performance. Examining the ways in which New Zealand's notions of national identity have affected its artistic production, this study considers claims that the particular environmental conditions of the land have imprinted themselves onto the nation's music. Furthermore, it investigates claims that New Zealand's remote and open spaces have generated perceptible effects in the nation's musical style, while also asking whether the purported importance of the landscape is not actually a myth which sits alongside the nation's other myths of identity. The literature regarding notions of 'musical space' is surveyed, bringing to light a number of musical elements which may connote space. Seven New Zealand orchestral works, composed between 1976 and 1995 and signalled by the composers as having some connection with the land, are found to share musical features, thus suggesting a national style insofar as 'landscape' works from this period are concerned. I then examine the works for 'space' elements, to investigate whether there are identifiable elements which connote a 'sense of space' in New Zealand music. A corollary of this belief in a national style is that any influences at work from New Zealand land(scapes) on New Zealand music will produce different musical results from those at work from other land(scapes) on music in other countries. After noting the most prevalent musical elements in the New Zealand works, four comparable 'landscape' orchestral works from other countries are also discussed, in order to offset and contextualize the New Zealand findings. This is the first detailed study of New Zealand music that has investigated national style, concepts of landscape-in-music, and musical space through analytical examination. It thus contributes to the small but growing body of New Zealand musical studies, and to an overall picture of New Zealand cultural identity.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Music)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/56</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1577056</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Results showed that most students could give a context in which they saw decimal fractions outside of school. The vast majority could draw a diagram of how a cake or field could be divided equally among 10 or 100 people. However, few students under 14 could give either decimal fraction symbols or common fraction symbols to represent these divisions. Less than half of the students at ages 10, 11 and 12 could visualize what might come between 0 and 1. About half of the students aged 11 and 12 could indicate what 0.1 or 0.01 meant. It was inferred that difficulty in relating these symbols to referents might be an important source of difficulty in understanding decimal fractions. Therefore, these interviews were followed by an intervention study that examined if working with contextualized decimal fractions aided understanding of these numbers when they were presented without context. Half of a group of 16 similar students, aged 11 and 12, were asked to solve problems in which numbers that incorporated decimal fractions were contextualized, and the other half were asked to solve similar problems given in purely numerical form. Students worked in pairs, on problems which incorporated common misconceptions. The group who worked on contextualized problems gained significantly more understanding than did the group that worked on purely numerical problems, as measured by the difference between pretest and posttest scores. Transcripts of the students' discussions were analysed for the effect of prior learning, aspects of peer collaboration that appeared to be beneficial to learning, and the effect of cognitive conflict. The students who gained most from collaboration were not too distant in initial expertise, showed a degree of social equity, and worked on contextualized problems. Much of students' learning appeared to result from needing to reconsider their views following a conflict between their expectations and the results of operating on a calculator or in writing, or hearing an alternative view.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1997.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/57</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9733788</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA677578</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The title-page (photographically reproduced) attributes the play to William Shakespeare. This claim is assessed and judged to be mistaken. Both external and internal evidence have been examined in relation to eight possible authorship candidates; Thomas Dekker emerges as the strongest. The present text of the play is based on the 1605 Quarto. Collation of twelve copies revealed several press variants.    The introduction treats the play's publication and stage-history and takes a critical look at its background and sources, plot and structure, setting, characters, style, themes, and role in the development of Elizabethan-Jacobean drama. An attempt is made to determine the date of composition, as well as the author. A short section is devoted to conjecture about the manuscript copy used for the Quarto and to bibliographical deductions about its treatment in the printing-house.    A full commentary glosses obscurities and enlarges on the play's literary, social, and historical allusions. There are textual notes on variants, emendations, and lineation. An appendix reproduces the parable of the Prodigal Son from the 1568 Bishops' Bible.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>1989</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/58</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9313712</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA112287</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The results of the literary analysis indicated that the texts displayed different textual tendencies and also represented God, the four main characters, and some minor characters, differently. The texts were then presented to real readers for an empirical study of their perceptions of the characters. The empirical data indicate some support for the difference in perception expected from the literary analysis.    Readers of the AT considered the king to be more just, Mordecai to be more just and moral, and less dominant, and Esther to be more moral, than in the other two texts. Readers of the BT considered Mordecai more dominant than in the other two texts. For the justice of the king and the justice and morality of Mordecai they rated the BT between the AT and the MT. Readers of the MT considered the king to be less just and Mordecai to be less just and moral than in the other texts. However, for the dominance trait they rated Mordecai between the AT and BT. They also rated Esther between the AT and BT on the morality trait. Some of these effects, however, were modified by the factors of gender and religious affiliation.    The literary analysis also suggested that there is a difference in the moral reasoning level between the three texts. This was indirectly supported by the empirical study. The fact that all except one of the differences in perception were related to the character traits of justice and morality indicates that the character traits which are most obviously related to the ethics involved in the text were the ones for which real readers perceived differences.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/59</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9943764</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA867032</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

This topic is important because of the strategic value of manufacturer brands and the increasing influence of resellers within channels of distribution. Much of the branding research has emphasised a customer brand knowledge perspective, however emerging perspectives suggest that brands are also relevant to other stakeholders including resellers. In contrast channels research has recognised the manufacturer sources of market power, but has not considered the impact of manufacturer 'push and pull' strategies within channels. A comprehensive theoretical framework therefore did not exist that addressed the reseller perspective of the brand. As a result, a multi-method research design was adopted and consisted of two phases. The first phase involved in-depth interviews, from which a conceptual framework was developed. In the second phase this framework was tested by means of a survey of supermarket buyers on major and minor brands in several product categories. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the survey responses. The structural model showed very good fit to the data and good construct validity, reliability and stability. Brands have several sources of value to resellers including manufacturer support, brand preference and customer demand which influence the reseller satisfaction with the brand. Reseller satisfaction in turn influences other channel outcomes such as trust, commitment and performance. Minor brands are better able to influence trust and commitment than major brands. A key contribution of this research is the development of a validated conceptual framework on the value of the brand in inter-organisational relationships from the point of view of a reseller. This research shows that it is the resources associated with the brand, not just the brand itself that creates value for resellers in channel relationships.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Rod Brodie</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Marketing)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/60</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3156559</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1446786</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Echocardiography is often used in HF patients because it provides important aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic information to assist physician management at moderate cost. This thesis has explored contemporary echocardiographic techniques for assessment of both diastolic and systolic function to ascertain their effectiveness and optimal utility. Assessment of systolic function in HF patients is optimised by the use of harmonic imaging and not enhanced with the use of transpulmonary contrast agents, whilst diastolic filling is optimised by the use of preload manipulation. When optimised in this way, echocardiography can be used to stratify HF patients in terms of risk of death and/or hospitalisation after discharge from hospital. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of more than 6000 patients (1000 deaths) with HF or after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where the presence of restrictive filling pattern (the most severe form of diastolic dysfunction) was associated with a four-fold increase in mortality in both patient groups. In addition, restrictive filling pattern also predicted development of HF post AMI and hospitalisation in patients with HF. This meta-analysis also evaluated the intermediate stages of diastolic dysfunction and found a stepped relationship between each grade and prognosis. The last part of this thesis explored the role of contemporary echocardiography for management of symptomatic patients in the community and found that the diagnosis of HF in the community may be optimised by using brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a first test to "rule-out" heart failure and then echocardiography, which was superior to BNP in patients with intermediate BNP levels to diagnose HF. Furthermore, the systolic echocardiographic parameters were important for diagnosis, whilst the diastolic parameters predicted future hospitalisation. In summary, contemporary echocardiography in HF patients should include comprehensive assessment of systolic function (using tissue harmonics imaging) and diastolic filling (utilising preload manipulation). This approach will optimise both diagnosis and prognosis and in turn may aid physician management.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate-Professor Robert Doughty</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Medicine)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/61</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1575237</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

While the parental initiative was in line with the rhetoric of Tomorrow' s Schools (1988) the contention in this thesis is that initiatives such as this were not intended by the legislation. Despite the fact that the initiative was stimulated by and explicitly invoked the rhetoric, the spirit of the legislation was philosophically opposed to this particular kind of innovation.    The ‘Kiwi’ initiative emerged in 1993, five years after the legislation. The initiative centred around a request for an alternative education programme to be set up within ‘Takiwa School’. This alternative was modelled on Playcentre, a New Zealand Early Childhood Education model, which encompasses aspects of progressivism. Kiwi parents and Takiwa School personnel achieved a ‘school within the school’ for a segment of Takiwa community. Parents became fully involved in all aspects of their children's curriculum, from planning, through to delivery and assessment. This thesis examines the politics of the change process within Takiwa School.    Three questions are central to this case study examination of change. These are: What were the parents asking for? How were the parents able to achieve what they were asking for? and What were the effects of the process on what it was that the initiative ultimately became? These three questions are examined in a sociological manner, from a critical realist approach. A range of theoretical tools are utilised; the central theoretical windows are a combination of Exit, Voice and Loyalty-which is provided by Hirschman (1970)-and the theories which are encompassed in the New Institutionalist approach. The central argument of the thesis is that it was a particular combination of conditions and motivations which made the Kiwi innovation possible. The possible replicability of the initiative is discussed. A key concern of the thesis as a whole is whether the set of circumstances in which the innovation transpired was unique.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2000.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/62</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9979146</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA933885</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The purpose of this thesis is to defend a four-facet model of teachers' conceptions of assessment, which revolves around emphasising improvement or school accountability, or student accountability purposes or treating assessment as irrelevant. Further, it explores how those conceptions relate to teachers' conceptions of learning, teaching, curriculum, and teacher efficacy.    A literature review is used to identify the major conceptions. Multiple studies led to a 50-item Teachers' Conceptions of Assessment (COA-III) questionnaire based on the four main conceptions of assessment. Structural equation modelling showed a close fit of a hierarchical, multi-dimensional model to the data. Teachers moderately agreed with the improvement conceptions and the system accountability conception. Teachers disagreed that assessment was irrelevant. However, teachers had little agreement that assessment was for student accountability. Improvement, school, and student accountability conceptions were positively correlated. The irrelevance conception was inversely related to the improvement conception and not related to the system accountability conception.    A four-factor structure of teachers' beliefs about assessment, curriculum, teaching, learning, and teacher efficacy, was found. Teachers agreed that assessment influences and improves their teaching and student learning. They agreed less strongly that assessment, measuring surface learning only, makes schools, teachers, and students accountable and that teachers are able to conduct assessment through a systematic technological approach. They agreed at a similar level with student centred learning that involves deep approaches to learning, divorced from assessment. They disagreed with a telling type of teaching that focuses only on intellectual development of students or on reconstruction or reform of society.    Use of the CoA-III makes teachers' conceptions of assessment more explicit and will assist in the development of teacher training programs, the design of assessment policy, and enhance further research into educational assessment practices. Furthermore, explicit attention to teachers' conceptions of assessment is expected to be a precursor to teachers' self-regulation of their assessment beliefs and practices.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor John Hattie</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Mike Townsend</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2002.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/63</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3189277</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1145577</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

contract-making other than that provided in the action of deceit on the case for a breach
of warranty. By and large this was the result of an evidential rule in covenant that a
contract had to be evidenced in a sealed instrument (ie. a specialty). This test for an
assumption of contractual obligation prevented the courts from receiving inferior oral
evidence of fraud in defence to the contract. A limited remedy for fraud was provided in
the form of the action of deceit on the case where liability was based on tricking another
person into contracting on the basis of a false warranty. Evidence of fraud in the action
of deceit on the case was reduced to proving a breach of warranty. Any injustice created
by the common law’s inability to provide a defence or remedy for other types of
fraudulent contract-making was either relieved in equity, or through the passage of time
and gradual common law development, by new common law actions, rules of evidence
and methods of trial. By far the most significant development in this regard was the
establishment of a remedy for fraud in money had and received in the late seventeenth
century, which led to the common law rule allowing for rescission of a contract for fraud.
Any money passed under the fraudulently induced contract could be recovered in money
had and received following rescission. Likewise, the value of any personal property
transferred under the fraudulently induced contract could be recovered in trover
following a rescission. Related developments saw warranties become actionable in
special assumpsit (ie. contract), and a generic remedy for actual fraud develop in the

I argue that the struggles of daily life in local communities and institutional groups can produce ideological spaces into which new practices, arising from increased consciousness of issues, can be developed.    My aim has been to uncover women's experiences in a way that not only interprets meanings from their practices, but also encourages such practices to be seen as valid renderings of women's understandings. I examine women's initiatives through the analysis of varying contexts. While I acknowledge the historical importance of the domestic situation as a threshold for much historic activism, women's proactivity requires a broader situational analysis. I therefore present cases of proactivity within the domestic, public and business spheres, within the two cities of Waitakere and North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand.    Through the search for new progressive social identities, women's activities at the inter-personal level are a prime source of social change. It is through the recursive relationship between women as agents and the social structure, that changing interpretations of social expectations are produced, allowing for creative activism. While women's initiatives may aim to transform particular social environments, they become part of the incremental process of change that alters the experience and structure of women's lives.    The thesis has four parts. The first outlines the scope, objectives and theoretical framework, while the second conceptualises women's agency and its positioning within social gendered structures. Part Three presents the investigative processes linking the theoretical framework and the empirical analysis. Part Four submits the thematic interpretations of the thesis, concluding that women can be agents of social change in a diversity of ways.    I acknowledge my feminist stance, one with layerings of objectives and motivations. I view women's circumstances as resulting from the interweaving of structural forces and personal capacities. The resulting awareness of women's experiences can challenge the values and concepts of masculine discourses. This is viewed through the concept of multiplicity. On a political level this means creating a resistance to hierarchies and a commitment to a plurality of voice, style and structure.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/65</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9908064</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA845998</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The emphasis is on the process of the Samoanising of christianity, and hegemonic identity discourses of not only the dominant society but of island-born Samoans
and elders, and how this contributes to New Zealand-born Samoan self perceptions. A socio-historical overview provides an understanding of the process in which New Zealand born Samoans have been positioned. The stories and narratives of a group of New Zealandborn
Samoans concerning their life experiences provide valuable insights into their 'identity journeys'--the construction of ethnic identity through experimenting with subject positions
over time, as a result of challenges to their percieved self-identities. For some, this journey ends with a secured identity--a self-satisfying ethnic identity as a New Zealand-born Samoan--others remain in a perpetual state of conscious or subconscious identity confusion. More specifically the thesis seeks to provide an understanding and an interpretation of the way fa'aSamoa, church, and life in New Zealand impacts on life choices and on the construction of the self, and secured identities. The identity journey is analysed as a ritual and a series of rites of passage in order to expose the structure of identity confusion, and to
examine the dichotomy of chaos and conflict within an apparently ordered society, experienced by New Zealand-born Samoans during their identity journeys.The thesis is therefore underpinned by Samoan conceptual frameworks involved in
this identity journey, and aims to consciousness-raise and emancipate by exposing, understanding and reclaiming the links between fa'aSamoa, church, and a New Zealand born Samoan identity.The thesis represents an 'ie toga,  because like a fine mat being woven, the strands of Samoan history, fa'aSamoa and Samoan contemporary lifeways, and their interaction with 'others' interconnect to inform Samoan identity. It is thus presented with respect, gratitude, deference, recognition and obligation, a tangible symbol of an alliance and an
exchange with all Samoans and others. As the wellspring of my Samoan identity, in its creativity in design and fineness of weave, I hope that this 'ie toga will be received as a source of identity, history and wealth.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr Judith Huntsman</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Cluny Macpherson</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr Malama Meleiseâ</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/66</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA861186</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

At the same time, the ledge formed on the sidewall has important consequences with regards to the cell service life and the dynamic heat balance during various disturbances associated with the smelting operation such as alumina feeding, anode changing, metal tapping and anode effect. Several studies have been carried out to investigate the ledge heat transfer. However, the reported heat transfer coefficients in the literature not only vary over a wide range of values but provide insufficient information on the ledge heat transfer.    A heat transfer probe and measurement techniques were developed for studying the ledge heat transfer in a full-scale 3-D air-water model. Quantitative measurements were conducted to determine the bath/ledge heat transfer characteristics at various positions, and under different operating conditions such as anode-ledge distance, current density and bath depth. Variation of the heat transfer were also examined as a function of the anode bottom inclination, the anode slot width and the position on the side ledge relative to the anode slot. The results illustrate that the ledge profile in an operating cell will take on a different shape in compliance with the heat transfer variation.    A similitude analysis was carried out to interpret the measured results in a meaningful manner for use in a reduction cell. As a result, the heat transfer coefficient in industrial cells under various operating parameters, and at different positions on the side ledge, can be estimated using the empirical correlations presented.    Gas bubble behaviour and bubble impingement on the side ledge were observed in the water model. Observations made on the 2-D and 3-D water models indicate that anode gas evolution in the 3-D model cell will reflect more closely the flow pattern in actual cells and hence provide more reliable quantitative results.    A simple 2-D thermal model for the prediction of ledge thickness and profile as a moving boundary was developed and solved simply and efficiently with a commercial spreadsheet software using the finite difference method. The ledge profile was predicted using the ledge heat transfer coefficients measured extensively from the full-scale 3-D physical model. The results show that the ledge shape is highly sensitive to the positional variation of the heat transfer coefficient. It is also shown that the ledge heat transfer coefficients obtained from industrial measurements assuming 1-D heat flow are much lower than the actual values in a Hall-Heroult cell.    A transient thermal model derived by considering the Stefan problem$/sp[*]$ for the sidewall/ledge region was developed. A fixed-grid and deforming-grid spacing were respectively superimposed on the sidewall and the ledge region in order to track the moving front of the phase change zone. Various aspects of the process dynamics with respect to the variation of ledge thickness and sidewall shell temperature were presented. The model considered dynamic heat loss through the sidewall which results in a closer approximation to the real situation. ftn$/sp[*]$N.B.: In the strict sense the problem of the ledge is not a classical Stefan problem. The classical Stefan problem involves conduction on both sides of the interface. The ledge problem involves conduction on the side and convection on the other.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>1996</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Chemical and Material Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1996.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/67</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9701545</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA753291</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

In the late 1940s and again in the late 1960s and early 1970s these same capture-recapture methods were modified and applied to epidemiological list data. Since then through their continued use, in particular in the 1990s, these methods have become popular for the estimation of the completeness of disease registries and for the estimation of the unknown total size of human disease populations.    In this thesis we investigate new methods for the analysis of epidemiological list data using capture-recapture methods. In particular we compare two standard methods used to estimate the unknown total population size, and examine new methods which incorporate list mismatch errors and model-selection uncertainty into the process for the estimation of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. We study the use of modified tag loss methods from animal abundance estimation to allow for list mismatch errors in the epidemio-logical list data. We also explore the use of a weighted average method, the use of Bootstrap methods, and the use of a Bayesian model averaging method for incorporating model-selection uncertainty into the estimate of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. In addition we use two previously unanalysed Diabetes studies to illustrate the methods examined and a well-known Spina Bifida Study for simulation purposes.    This thesis finds that ignoring list mismatch errors will lead to biased estimates of the unknown total population size and that the list mismatch methods considered here result in a useful adjustment. The adjustment also approximately agrees with the results obtained using a complex matching algorithm. As for the incorporation of model-selection uncertainty, we find that confidence intervals which incorporate model-selection uncertainty are wider and more appropriate than confidence intervals that do not. Hence we recommend the use of tag loss methods to adjust for list mismatch errors and the use of methods that incorporate model-selection uncertainty into both point and interval estimates of the unknown total population size.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Statistics)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/68</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3085723</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1013221</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

When that mission was finished the second coming would occur.    In 1886 following a visit by an elderly layman, John I Tay, the whole population of Pitcairn Island desired to join the SDA church. As a result in 1890 Adventist mission work began in the South Pacific Islands. By 1895 missions had been founded in six island groups. However difficulties, both within and without the mission's control, ensured that membership gains were painfully slow in the first decades of Adventist mission in Polynesia. However before World War II the Solomons became one of the most successful Adventist mission areas in the world. After 1945 Adventism also prospered in such places as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.    Education provided the key to the gaining of accessions in a number of countries, while in others a health-medical emphasis proved important in attracting converts. Since World War II public evangelism and the use of various programmes such as welfare, radio evangelism, and the efforts of lay members contributed to sharp membership gains in most countries of the region. Of no small consequence in hindering Adventist growth was the opposition of other churches who regarded them as pariahs because of their theology and 'proselytizing'.    Adventist communities tended to be introverted, esoteric and isolationist. Nevertheless Pacific islanders adapted aspects of the usually uncompromising Adventist culture. Unity of faith, practice and procedure was a valuable Adventist asset which was promoted by a centralized administration.    After a century in the Pacific region its membership there has a reputation among other Adventists for its continued numeric growth and for the ferver its committment to Adventism. Nevertheless Adventism in the region faces a number of problems and its aim of finishing the Lord's work remains unfinished.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Hugh Laracy</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>1990</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--History)--University of Auckland, 1989.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/69</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9100749</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA394154</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Flow is modelled through these networks enabling structure-function simulations to be conducted to increase our understanding of this complex system.Voronoi meshing is applied in a novel technique to represent the three-dimensional structure of the alveoli, and the corresponding capillary plexus intimately wrapped over the alveolar surface. This technique is used to create the alveolar-capillary structure of a single alveolar sac,  closely representing the geometry measured in anatomical studies.A Poiseuille type flow solution technique is implemented within the capillary geometry. The solution procedure incorporates calculations of red and white blood cell transit time frequencies. Novel predictions of regional microcirculatory blood cell transit in the anatomically-realistic alveolar-capillary model compare well with experimental measures.An anatomically-based finite element model of the arterial and venous vessels, down to the level of their accompanying respiratory bronchioles, is created using a combination of imaging and computational algorithms, which includes generation of supernumerary vessels. Large arterial and venous vessels and lobar geometries are derived from multi-detector row x-ray computed tomography (MDCT) scans. From these MDCT vessel end points a volume-filling branching algorithm is used to generate the remaining blood vessels that accompany the airways into the MDCT-derived host volume. An  empirically-based algorithm generates supernumerary blood vessels - unaccompanied by airways that branch to supply the closest parenchymal tissue. This new approach produces a model of pulmonary vascular geometry that is far more anatomically-realistic than previous models in the literature.A reduced form of the Navier-Stokes equations are solved within the vascular geometries to yield pressure, radius, and velocity distributions. Inclusion of a gravitational term in the governing equations allows application of the model in investigating the relative effects of gravity, structure, and posture on regional perfusion.Gravity is shown to have a lesser influence on blood flow distribution than suggested by earlier experimental studies, and by comparison between different model solutions the magnitude of the gravitational flow gradient is predicted. This study clearly demonstrates the significant role that  symmetric vascular branching has in determining the distribution of blood  flow. The influence of branching geometry is revealed by solution in symmetric, human, and ovine vascular models.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Bioengineering)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/70</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1506084</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Teacher appraisal, a central element of performance management, is intended to improve the quality of teaching (and therefore learning). This thesis examines whether teacher appraisal is achieving this purpose, through three empirical studies. This thesis begins with a discussion of the context of teacher appraisal in relation to education reform of the last two decades. A normative model of teacher appraisal, one that focuses on data-based inquiry into student learning, is outlined, and the emerging education context in relation to that model is examined. Three studies, which explored schools' appraisal documents, appraisal discussions and teachers' appraisal goals, are presented. The first study, a document analysis, investigated the emphasis on student learning in the statements of purpose in 17 primary schools' appraisal policies, and the emphasis on student learning in the performance indicators developed to assess teachers against the professional standards. Results showed that while improved student learning was an intended purpose of schools' appraisal policies, the indicators that were used to evaluate teachers seldom focused directly on student learning.The second study examined whether data-based inquiry into student learning occurs in appraisal discussions, and the reasons for the level of reported inquiry. Eleven practitioners (four appraisers and seven appraisees from three schools) were interviewed about their most recent appraisal discussion to investigate whether student learning was a focus of the appraisal discussions and whether student achievement data were referred to in those discussions. Findings showed that appraisal discussions typically focused on teacher practices without exploring connections between those practices and the impact they have on student learning.Only one of the eleven teachers described a discussion that included talk specifically about student learning. Furthermore, there were no reports of reference to student learning data in appraisal discussions. There was, however, a particularly positive response to the suggestion that appraisal should, and could, focus on student learning and on data relating to this learning. This study also highlighted the considerable influence of appraisal goals in determining the content and scope of appraisals. In the third study, 68 teachers from eight schools responded to a questionnaire about their appraisal goals to establish the extent to which teachers' appraisal goals focus on data-based inquiry into student learning. Less than five per cent of goals were found to refer to student outcomes. The vast majority focused on teacher processes and behaviours. Goals also tended to be vague, rather than specific, and were not explicitly challenging. Findings across the studies suggest that only limited attention is given, in critical elements of teacher appraisal, to student learning. The final chapter of the thesis explores two key strategies for closing the gap between current appraisal practices and the 'appraisal for learning' approach argued for here - an approach that focuses on teacher learning about student learning and that is based on evidence. The first strategy involves alignment within appraisal elements, and to initiatives beyond appraisal. The second strategy is capacity building to ensure that personal, interpersonal and organisational capacities necessary for 'appraisal for learning' are developed. This research shows how teacher appraisal policy and practice has been a missed opportunity to improve teaching effectiveness and how it could be reshaped in ways that maximise student learning.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/71</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1572918</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Linear Neumann-Kelvin ship wave theory is taken as a starting point for the development of a computational approach for predicting water flow about yacht hulls. Previous work by Baar and Price, Newman, and Doctors and Beck for the calculation of the Kelvin source and its derivatives and their use with panel methods is repeated, refined and extended.    Consistent and accurate results are obtained for numerical tests and Farell's submerged spheroid test cases.    Baar and Price's results for the Wigley hullform (which compare well with experiments) were not able to be duplicated in the present study, despite significant tests of both local and integrated solution values. The tests did indicate that the current implementation was behaving correctly, and gave wave resistance results equivalent to those from Doctors and Beck's study, to a level of agreement which contrasted sharply with the wide scatter in Chen and Noblesse's survey. These results remove to some extent numerical inaccuracies as a postulated source of the theory's difficulties, leaving the conclusion that Neuman-Kelvin theory, as it is currently understood, does not give satisfactory wave resistance results for realistic ship hullforms.    These and further results lead to, and reinforce, the suggestion that the problem lies with the waterline integral term; a new treatment of this term may substantially increase the applicability of Neumann-Kelvin theory.    The extensions required for modelling sailing yachts are considered. Investigation of three yacht design problems show that the developed model can predict, and partly explain, previously observed free surface effects. These 'relative' effects may be adequately predicted even though the absolute results appear less reliable.    For the simplified parabolic yacht hullform tested, the sideforce is relatively constant over the speed range generally relevant to upwind sailing, and well modelled by the (zero Froude number) cosine squared (heel angle) relationship. The effects of a bulb, and heel (for the Wigley hullform), on wave resistance are shown.    Suggestions for further work, calculation details, and tables of wave resistance and Kelvin source (and gradient) values are given.</dc:description><dc:description>Available in ProQuest Dissertation database.

In the primary phase, logs are sawn into s labs of wood known as flitches or cants. These are further processed by secondary operations, that resaw, edge (cut lengthwise) and trim (cut widthwise) the raw material, resulting in the manufacture of the board product whose value is influenced by its composite dimensions and quality (as indicated by a grade). Board grade is in turn determined by the number, type, size, and location of defects.    Owing to its biological origins, each log, and subsequent board, is unique. Furthermore, as each sawmill, and processing centre within the mill, has a unique configuration, the problem of determining how each log entering a mill should be sawn is very complex. Effective computer simulation of log breakdown processes must therefore entail detailed descriptions of both geometry and quality of individual logs. Appropriate strategies at each breakdown phase are also required.    In this thesis models for emulating log breakdown are developed in conjunction with an existing sawing simulation system which requires, as input, detailed three-dimensional descriptions of both internal and external log characteristics. Models based on heuristic and enumerative procedures, and those based upon the principles of dynamic programming (DP) are formulated, encoded, and compared. Log breakdown phases are considered both independently and in a combined integrated approach-working backwards from the board product through to the primary log breakdown phase. This approach permits methodology developed for the later processes to be embedded within the primary phase thus permitting the determination of a global rather than local solution to the log breakdown problem whose objective is to seek the highest possible solution quality within the minimum possible time.    Simulation results indicate that solution quality and processing speeds are influenced by both solution methodology and degree of data complexity. When the structure of either factor is simplified, solutions are generated more rapidly-but with an accompanying reduction in solution quality. A promising compromise that combines DP techniques with mathematical functions based on a subset of the original data is presented.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Engineering Science)--University of Auckland, 1997.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/73</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9913695</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA755013</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

My over-arching goal in this research was to use modern computing power to create functionally useful diagnoses, in real time, from the monitoring systems used during routine anaesthesia and to present these diagnoses in an ergonomic manner. In addition it was intended to incorporate into the anaesthetic monitor, expert systems that help with the management of uncommon situations. The Australian and New Zealand College guidelines on monitoring during anaesthesia dictate those measurements that should be made during every anaesthetic; from these data evidence can be gathered, integrated, and presented to the clinician. Constraints in this field of research include the inability of the monitors to see, hear or understand the context of operating theatre activities, and computer processing time. Because many studies are involved the methods are detailed in the main text, and are not summarized here. Physiological 'envelopes' have been developed, in which the 'normal' variation in physiological variables, during anaesthesia, are enclosed. They have enabled the creation of intelligent alarm systems that can suggest diagnoses. A retrospective off-line study showed that it was possible to diagnose the onset of malignant hyperpyrexia, using fuzzy logic templates, about 10minutes earlier than the clinician. Some variables may be more important than others in making a diagnosis, and the strength of a diagnosis depends on the amount of supporting evidence, the amount of evidence not against the diagnosis and the amount of missing data. Decision-making (for example to transfuse or not transfuse blood) can also be mathematically modelled so that decision making is more consistent. Finally, investigation of the ways of displaying data indicates that the output can be very explicit. My overall conclusion is that real time decision support systems for the management of clinical dilemmas are possible. They can be instantly and easily accessible and can sit discretely in the background of anaesthetic monitors to be activated at will by the anaesthetist.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (MD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/74</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1686907</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

I point out that what we are inclined to believe about the justification of egoistic concern, let's call it the Old Theory, is that personal identity is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, that personal identity involves a deep further fact, and that physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for personal identity.    I argue that, if personal identity involves the deep further fact, then physical and psychological continuity are not good evidence for personal identity and thus the Old Theory is mistaken. Furthermore, if the everyday egoistic concern that we have for a person who is physically and psychologically continuous with us is clearly rational, then physical and psychological continuity must be good evidence for the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, and thus either personal identity is not the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, or personal identity does not involve the deep further fact. Therefore, I suggest that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should have the following structure; some relationship, let's call it E, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, E does not involve the deep further fact, and physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for E.    I then point out that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should take into account the dominant intuitions that the Old Theory was based on, but should ignore intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs flowing from the Old Theory. I argue that it is not easy to separate these two types of intuitions, but, nevertheless, in trying to find E I attempt to capture the intuitions that underlie the Old Theory, while avoiding the use of methods that might capture intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs involved in the Old Theory.    After considering the various candidates for E, I conclude that psychological continuity, even if it occurs coincidentally, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Philosophy)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/75</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9935125</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA869175</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The broad objectives of the ethnographic research contributing to this thesis were to study the historical context of this small-scale voluntary migration, the establishment and social organisation of culturally distinguished urban communities in North Island centres, and post-resettlement outcomes experienced by migrant and descent populations. Each of the two studies incorporated in the thesis is primarily concerned with tūpulaga ‘the younger generation’ in the New Zealand Tokelau population. One is community-based and focused on the social interactions of generation cohorts of tūpulaga  and tupuna ‘elders’, the formal community associations and the national association of affiliated tūpulaga  groups. The other is concerned with bunches of “detached” tūpulaga geographically scattered throughout the country, the people without voices when research includes only the migrants in urban enclaves. Background considerations include overviews of theoretical approaches to studying the population phenomenon of migration; relevant aspects of Tokelau history and the movement of Pacific peoples; New Zealand as the receiving country and continuously changing social context for Tokelau communities, and a conceptual framework derived from features of complex adaptive systems theories that was helpful in considering aspects of the contemporary migration and its outcomes. Tūpulaga leaders, through the association of affiliated groups known as the Mafutaga, revived the pre-eminent cultural principle  maopoopo ‘gathered together and unified’, promoted a vision of ‘Tokelau ways in New Zealand’ and supported tūpulaga “becoming Tokelau in New Zealand” as residents of urban communities. Over a number of years, Mafutaga officials led the expansion of tūpulaga inter-community sports meetings into a four-day national gathering of Tokelauans now celebrated as an unequivocal expression of Tokelau culture in New Zealand, and guided the established urban communities through a transition from migrant to cultural communities without usurping the political roles of esteemed elders.    The second study shows that intergenerational issues were pivotal or contributory in most tūpulaga decisions to “detach” from community networks and activities. “Detachment” is categorised as transient (a provisional, not necessarily long-term status), tacit (a restorative withdrawal, with subsequent reattachment) or diuternal (a considered choice and enduring status).</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/76</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9928380</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA865930</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The computational framework required to produce such electrical images of the heart from non-invasive torso surface signals is presented. It is shown reliable electrical images of the heart can be obtained under a controlled environment. This has been demonstrated using an anatomically realistic boundary element porcine torso model. The procedures required to create a subject specific model using a small number of control points and to create a specific heart model from three-dimensional ultrasound images using a linear fitting procedure are presented. From discrete ECG electrodes a continuous representation of the potential field over the entire torso surface can also be produced using this linear fitting procedure. The construction of the transfer matrices for the two predominant electrocardiographic sources (epicardial potentials and myocardial activation times) are described in detail. The transfer matrices are used to compute activation times within the heart and epicardial potentials on the heart surface. Myocardial activation times are computed using an algorithm based on the Critical Point Theorem while epicardial potentials are computed using standard Tikhonov and Truncated SVD spatially regularised methods as well as Greensite's spatial and temporal regularisation method. The regularisation parameters for the epicardial potentials are determined using a variety of methods (e.g., CRESO criterion, L-curve, zero-crossing). The potential and activation based formulations are compared in a comprehensive inverse simulation study. To try and capture the dynamic and variable nature of cardiac electrical activity, the study is performed with three different types of cardiac sources with a realistic porcine model. These simulations investigate the effect on the computed solutions of individual and combinations of modelling errors. These errors include corruption in the torso surface signals, changes in material properties and geometric distortion. In general, the activation based formulation is preferred over the epicardial potential formulations, with Greensite's method found to be the best method for reconstructing epicardial potentials. Under optimal conditions, the activation approach could reconstruct the activation times to within RMS. Both potential and activation based formulations were found to be relatively insensitive to changes in material properties such as lung conductivities and activation function shapes. When examining individual errors, the geometry and positions of the torso and heart had the greatest effects on the inverse solutions. The relative heart position needed to be determined to within to obtain results within of the solutions obtained under control conditions. When the modelling errors are combined to produce errors which can be expected in a clinical or experimental situation the activation based solutions were consistently more accurate than potential based solutions. The next necessary step in this project is the detailed validation of the results against in-vivo data. This step is necessary before such algorithms can be reliably used to aid in the assessment of heart function in a clinical environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Engineering Science)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/77</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1018127</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The concept is considered in detail, as is the question of who can have interests. The conclusion on that is that individuals and the public are the only true categories of interest holders, although interest groups need to be recognised for practical reasons. Corporations and governments cannot be true interest holders.    The application of the concept was assessed in relation to the subject-matter of urban land use planning, and a typical land use planning process. The possibility of applying it to a hypothetical system of planning using the pragmatic method was also considered.    The final part looked at the ‘institutions’ of planning, that is, law, politics, professional planning, administration, and administrative tribunals, to see how they would likely relate to a planning system based on the use of the concept of interest. The conclusion was that there would be no insurmountable difficulties even If not all of these institutions would readily embrace the concept.    The idea was found to be plausible in so far as a comprehensive theory of interest-based urban land use planning was able to be worked out. By considering practical issues throughout, a strong presumption was raised that it would be feasible, although testing and further development of the idea would be necessary.    Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method were reviewed. The expected benefits were ensuring that public urban land use system planning was humanistic, and providing a concept, or theme, around which a comprehensive theory of such planning could be constructed. Likely areas of difficulty were misunderstanding due to the lack of agreement on the meaning of the concept, although the meaning that should be adopted for the proposed purpose was spelt out. Secondly, a conservative attitude towards the use of concepts other than interest in planning and related disciplines could cause resistance to the adoption of the proposed method.    It was shown how the idea is largely novel, but that recently there has been increasing use of the concept of interest in the land use planning literature.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Planning)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/78</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9933674</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA861077</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The analyses reveal that paradigm shifts in translation theory occur when the changes in the social, economic, cultural and religious environments lead to significant changes in the practice of translation and that these changes then can no longer be adequately theorised by the old paradigms of translation. This study then critically reviews current literature on globalisation and translation and attributes its lack of depth in theorisation or some of its misleading predictions to certain scholars' inadequate investigation of the phenomenon of globalisation.    In order to provide an adequate interpretation, description, explanation and prediction of the impact of globalisation on the theory and practice of translation, I investigate five aspects of globalisation and their respective impact on translation practice and find that globalisation has changed the mainstream of translation practice from canonical translation to professional (i.e., non-canonical) translation. The findings of the research demonstrate that traditional translation theories based on comparative literary study or on linguistics fail to provide an objective and comprehensive theoretical framework for the mainstream practice of translation. Therefore, it is justifiable to posit a paradigm shift in Translation Studies from canonical translation to professional translation so as to meet the demand of and challenges for the translation profession and business under the impact of globalisation. As an initiation towards the establishment of a new paradigm, I posit a “value-driven” theory based on recent developments in researches on the global economy to distinguish between canonical and professional translations. Influenced by theories of the knowledge-driven economy, I further propose to establish a force of translators as knowledge workers to better serve the demand of the global economy and the global community. To follow the principle of empiricism, I use several case studies from the real world of commercial translation to support my “value-driven” theory for Translation Studies.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Translation Studies)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/80</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3173563</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1485831</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

One less apparent aspect of the language of children is their private speech. In this thesis the research questions focus on whether children from diverse language backgrounds attending English-speaking kindergartens use private speech. Further, if so, what is the context, who is present when it is used and is there a response from the person or people? These questions are primarily addressed through observations of eight children as well as recordings of their private speech. An understanding of the context is supported through interviews with the parents and teachers in the kindergartens. The expectations for this research were largely based on the work of Vygotsky, and adapted to the natural, 'free play' environments of the kindergartens. It was expected that children from diverse language backgrounds in English medium kindergartens would use private speech in their own language. While the children did use private speech (unlike the results from Vygotsky's research) they talked to themselves in English using the language that they had acquired from the community, from the media, from their experiences at kindergarten and in some cases from their families. Based on Krafft &amp; Berk's categories of private speech, a significant focus of this research is the categories of private speech that were used by individual children. These findings pose interesting insight into the experiences of the children. This research has shown the child's remarkable ability to tune into the language and culture of context and to do so not only in relation to the socio-cultural context but also through thinking and acting. This study has also provided insight into the early childhood environments and the experiences of the teachers. As the first known research into private speech/self-talk in early childhood in Aotearoa New Zealand it can serve as a spring-board for further research to enhance our understanding of the child's thinking and learning through private speech.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/81</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1664491</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In this thesis I apply the insights of current best theory in evolutionary psychology to the problem of deciding between theological realism, which holds that religious beliefs are about some aspect of mind-independent reality, and theological non-realism, which holds that religious beliefs are mind-dependent only. The most well-known exponent of theological non-realism is Don Cupitt who bases his approach to the problem on a combination of biological naturalism and culturalism. In the first part of this thesis I show that biological naturalism and culturalism are incompatible and that culturalism should be rejected in favor of biological naturalism. Cupitt's biological naturalism is the forerunner of an evolutionary psychological approach to religious beliefs that holds great promise for determining their correct interpretation. In the second part of this thesis I critically examine the foundations of evolutionary psychology and its subsequent development into an approach to religious belief in particular.    Current evolutionary theories of culture, including religious belief, use Meme theory, which seems, on the face of it, to be a theory analogous to that of natural selection. I show that the memetic approach to religious belief is mistaken but that there is a sound alternative in the work of Pascal Boyer. Boyer draws on evolutionary psychology, anthropology and cognitive science to develop an account of the origin in the mind of religious beliefs and their spread through the population.    My evolutionary argument is that religious beliefs are the result of the current but not proper function of cognitive modules. Only if beliefs are the result of the proper function of cognitive modules are we justified in holding them to be about some aspect of mind-independent reality. Theological realism is blocked because all versions of realism in the literature depend to some degree on the fact of religious experience, which is covered by the evolutionary argument. Theological non-realism is supported, in principle, by the evolutionary argument but, in practice, is not a genuine alternative to realism because religious beliefs are automatically given a realist interpretation that competes with explicit nonrealist interpretations.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>John Bishop</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Philosophy)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/82</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3135504</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1214544</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

From a review of the literature, it is argued that the most salient feature of individualism is valuing personal independence, which includes self-knowledge, uniqueness, privacy, clear communication, and competitiveness. Collectivism is associated with a strong sense of duty to group, relatedness to others, seeking others' advice, harmony, and working with the group. The purpose of the thesis is to explore how collectivist and individualist attributes affect the way people respond to Likert-type questionnaires.    In the first study, a new measurement tool for individualism and collectivism was developed to address critical methodological issues in this field of cross-cultural psychology. This new measure the “Auckland Individualism and Collectivism Scale” defined three dimensions of individualism: (a) Responsibility (acknowledging one's responsibility for one's actions), (b) Uniqueness (distinction of the self from the other) and (c) Compete (striving for personal goals is one's prime interest); and two dimensions of collectivism: (d) Advice (seeking advice from people close to one, before taking decisions), and (e) Harmony (seeking to avoid conflict). The AICS avoids the need for measuring horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism, and the confounding effect of familialism on the collectivism-individualism constructs.    The second study investigated the relationship between collectivism and individualism and various response sets that have been reported relating to the way in which individuals respond to Likert-type scales. Using structural equation modelling, the Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias was developed. This model suggests two types of response sets: (a) the Impression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as social desirability and context, that affect the first four stages of responding to questions, namely receiving and retrieving data and making decisions; and (b) the Expression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as the extreme response set and the neutral response set that relate to the application of the responses, namely the actual answer chosen by the respondent. Collectivism is negatively correlated with context and with self deception enhancement whereas individualism is positively correlated with context and self deception enhancement and impression management. Context is positively correlated with extreme response set and negatively correlated with neutral response set. The Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias suggests that collectivist and individualist attributes directly affect the Impression-Response Bias response sets and indirectly affect the Expression-Response Bias response sets. It was concluded that attributes of collectivism and individualism affect the decision made by the respondents and therefore lead to different responses to Likert-type questionnaires. Nevertheless, the effect of collectivism and individualism on the magnitude of the responses would be limited as it is mediated by the Impression-Response Bias response set.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/83</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3175087</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1491755</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The finite element method for finite deformation elasticity was developedfor the analysis and included specialised coordinate systems, interpolation schemesand parallel processing techniques for greater computational efficiency.The ventricular mechanics model incorporated the fully orthotropic pole-zero constitutivelaw, based on the three-dimensional architecture of myocardium, to account for the nonlinearmaterial response of resting cardiac muscle, relative to the three anatomically relevant axes.A fibre distribution model was introduced to reconcile some of the pole-zero constitutiveparameters with direct mechanical properties of the tissue (such as the limiting strainsestimated from detailed physiological observations of the collagen helices that surroundmyofibres), whilst other parameters were estimated from in-vitro biaxial tension tests onthin sections of myocardium. A non-invasive approach to in-vivo myocardial materialparameter estimation was also developed, based on a magnetic resonance imaging techniqueto effectively tag ventricular wall tissue.The spatially non-homogeneous distribution of myocardial residual strain was accounted forin the ventricular mechanics model using a specialised growth tensor. A simple model of fluidshift was formulated to account for the changes in local tissue volume due to movement ofintramyocardial blood. Contractile properties of ventricular myofibres were approximatedusing a quasi-static relationship between the fibre extension ratio, intracellular calciumconcentration and active fibre stress, and the framework has been developed to include amore realistic model of active myocardial mechanics, which could be coupled to a realisticdescription of the time-varying spread of electrical excitation throughout the ventricularwalls. Simple volumetric cavity models were incorporated to investigate the effects of arterialimpedance on systolic wall mechanics.Ventricular mechanics model predictions of the cavity pressure versus volume relationships,longitudinal dimension changes, torsional wall deformations and regional distributions ofmyocardial strain during the diastolic filling, isovolumic contraction and ejection phasesof the cardiac cycle showed good overall agreement with reported observations derivedfrom experimental studies of isolated and in-vivo canine hearts. Predictions of the spatialdistributions of mechanical stress at end-diastole and end-systole are illustrated.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Engineering Science)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/84</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA861150</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

In particular, it offers a useful addition to more established techniques for dating speleothems, which not only have relevance to Quaternary geomorphology but may also carry palaeomagnetic and palaeoclimatic data. This work consolidates the method of ESR dating, with special reference to calcite speleothems, and contributes to several important aspects of the methodology. Using a low energy nuclear accelerator as a source of alpha particles of various energies, it is shown that the effectiveness of alpha radiation in producing paramagnetic defects is energy dependent, and approximately linearly related to the range of the incident alpha; the implications for dose rate calculations are discussed, and ranges are calculated for alpha particles of different energies for various dating materials for use in applying the above finding. The alpha/gamma effectiveness ratio, k, is experimentally determined for 18 calcite speleothems as k$/sb[/rm av]$ = 0.052 $/pm$ 0.006, which is significantly less than most previous estimates. The k-value for a coral sample is 0.055. By examining the Th-230/Po-210 ratios of 19 speleothem samples it is shown that for almost all speleothems, radon is retained within the sample until its decay; thus the full radionuclide decay chains should be used in dose rate calculations. Analysis of 'typical' calcite spectra confirms that interference between peaks of different origins and stability affects the estimate of accumulated dose (AD), and provides a rational basis for decisions on different sample preparation methods and analytical procedures. The effect of these on age estimates is examined and routine experimental methods recommended. The effect of different ESR spectrometer operating parameters is also evaluated and it is shown that the use of high microwave power avoids potentially serious underestimation of the accumulated dose (AD). A straight-forward statistical method is developed; this enables confidence limits to be derived for AD and provides a test for equivalence of AD estimates, using standard linear hypothesis techniques. A robust Geiger Muller instrument sufficiently sensitive to give estimates of relative gamma dose rates in a few minutes is developed specifically for cave dosimetry. It has the potential, with further development and cross-calibration, to become a viable method for measuring absolute environmental gamma dose rates. Serious discrepancies between two 'absolute' dosimetry methods are revealed; this and other problems of environmental gamma dosimetry are discussed. The evaluation of gamma dose rates in calcite (with respect to both laboratory and field dosimetry) and the form of the dose response curve (including the possibility of supra-linearity and non-thermal instability) are identified as areas requiring further research.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Paul Williams</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Barry Brennan</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Peter Hosking</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Paul Williams</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Charmian O'Connor</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>1990</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1989.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/85</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9120206</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA135855</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Just like biologists, historical linguists infer relationships between the lineages they study by analysing heritable features. For linguists, these features can be words, grammar and phonemes. This linguistic evidence of descent with modification plays an important role in our understanding of human prehistory. However, conventional methods in historical linguistics do not employ an explicit optimality criterion to evaluate evolutionary language trees. These methods cannot quantify uncertainty in the inferences nor provide an absolute chronology of divergence events. Previous attempts to estimate divergence times from lexical data using glottochronological methods have been heavily criticized, particularly for the assumption of constant rates of lexical replacement. Computational phylogenetic methods from biology can overcome these problems and allow divergence times to be estimated without the assumption of constant rates. Here these methods are applied to lexical data to test hypotheses about human prehistory. First, divergence time estimates for the age of the Indo-European language family are used to test between two competing theories of Indo- European origin - the Kurgan hypothesis and the Anatolian farming hypothesis. The resulting age estimates are consistent with the age range implied by the Anatolian farming theory. Validation exercises using different models, data sets and coding procedures, as well as the analysis of synthetic data, indicate these results are highly robust. Second, the same methodology was applied to Mayan lexical data to infer historical relationships and divergence times within the Mayan language family. The results highlight interesting uncertainties in Mayan language relationships and suggest that the family may be older than previously thought. Finally, returning to biology, similar tree-building and model validation techniques are used to draw inferences about human origins and dispersal from human mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These analyses support a human origin 150,000-250,000 years ago and reveal time dependency in rates of mitochondrial DNA evolution. Population size estimates generated using a coalescent approach suggest a twophase human population expansion from Africa. Potential correlations between human genetic and linguistic diversity are highlighted. I conclude that there is much to be gained by linguists and biologists using the same methods and speaking the same language.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr Russell Gray</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2006.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/86</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1639381</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

It specifically considers, the Women's Centres, Women's Health Collectives, Women's Refuges and Rape Crisis groups. Feminism in the groups was closely linked to the internal processes of organising as a collective based on 'women's ways of working'. The groups merged a radical feminist political orientation with a service orientation as they developed services 'for women by women'. The study was based on a qualitative analysis of published and unpublished documents of activist service groups, and open-ended interviews with 65 women discussing their experiences of working in activist service groups. Two distinct phases of change to the internal organisation of the groups between 1970 and 1999 have been identified and examined. In the first phase, (1970s - 1980s), radical feminist collective ways of working acquired the status of a taken for granted institutional norm among the groups. These groups organised as women-only collectives, utilised consensus decision-making, embodied ideals of non-hierarchy, and had aspirations of sisterhood between women. The second phase (from the late 1980s) was marked by modification of the radical feminist collective, as groups experienced internal and external pressures to adopt bureaucratic practices. Major pressures included the shift by the state to contract funding of the groups, the changing participation of paid and unpaid workers in the daily work of the groups, and the increasing formal differentiation between employers and employees. These changes were a major source of conflict and tension, as the groups modified their organisations to include differentiation of roles, specialisation of positions and formal hierarchy. At the same time groups sustained aspects of radical feminist collective organising. Dealing with differences was a major site of tension and conflict in the activist service groups. Groups implemented various strategies to address differences between women in relation to race/ethnicity, sexuality and class. A major focus of the groups was the development of bicultural relations between Māori and non-Māori. Models of biculturalrelations in the predominantly Pākehā groups ranged from increasing Māori representation in the groups, to the formation of alliances between independent groups or alliances between ethnic-specific groups in the same organisation. These strategies were mostly framed in terms of a binary opposition between oppressed and oppressor, and along a single axis of oppression. Nevertheless, the groups' attempts to 'deal with differences' between women were important in challenging assumptions of genderbased commonality between all women. In spite of these conflicts and associated changes, participants in the activist service groups attempted to maintain inclusive, non-hierarchical, empowering organisations 'for women by women'. In the 1990s, many of the feminist activist service groups continued to pursue democratic collective ways of working and to engage in a politics of difference in their organisations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:11Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Women's Studies)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/87</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1467560</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

However, it has been examined primarily from the perspective of an unrealistically optimistic or unduly pessimistic view of the future, with few attempts to provide other alternatives.    This thesis is structured in three sections. The first backgrounds the context of the research question, the relevant literature, the prospect of gender bias in that literature and the historical development of government policy towards ageing. The second section presents a theoretical perspective for social change, examines the development of social movements and puts a case for a new social movement arising out of the increasing number of older adults and supporting educative processes. The third section reports on empirical research based on interviews in Australia and New Zealand with leaders of organisations involved with older adults and focuses on drawing conclusions from the research in relation to the research question.    The theory proposed in this thesis is based on the premise that an opportune time in history exists for older adults to contribute to social and political change. However, for senior members of society to undertake this role will require education in some form, to act as an agency or catalyst to initiate an organised social movement. Findings of this research support the view that the majority of older adults remain fit and healthy and do not conform to the medicalisation approach to ageing on which government policy and, to a large extent, public attitudes, have been formed. While there would be problems of organisation in the formation of a new social movement there are no insurmountable obstacles to overcome. The greatest difficulty would seem to lie in overcoming inertia, sectional interests, generating the leadership and developing innovative and imaginative educative processes.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Associate Professor Dr. Peter Roberts, University of Auckland</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr. Brian Findsen, University of Glasgow</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/88</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3205817</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1566502</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The religious presence in the war machine has been the subject of many debates, particularly those involving the conflict of ethics presented by the representation of a gospel of peace and love participating in a profession of violence and killing.    New Zealand is a secular country with a relatively well-developed system of secular pastoral care services. However the New Zealand Defence Force continues to request the churches' involvement in the military and those churches which respond continue to participate in work which appears contrary to their teaching. This study examines the relationship of church and military. It investigates the place of the church in the New Zealand Defence Force through an examination of the appropriate literature and other relevant information, and an empirical survey of the work and views of current, and some retired, chaplains.    The global military scenario has changed in recent years with the development of war technology. The New Zealand military focus is now largely directed towards policing New Zealand's economic zone and the preservation of independence of smaller neighbouring island states, while its active service role is one of participation in international peace-enforcement and peacekeeping. This thesis considers these changes and looks at the possible effects they may have on the future of military chaplaincy within the secular, multicultural context of the New Zealand state. The study concludes with a rationale for the presence of the Christian Church in the New Zealand Defense Force and presents issues which the current chaplaincy-providing churches need to consider if they wish to continue to provide effective chaplaincy for the military.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Theology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/89</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9990812</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA934422</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Since mineralogists adopted the German mining term 'grauwacke' in the 1780s to refer to a type of old, hard, grey, muddy sandstone, both the name and the rock have caused confusion and controversy. English geologists in the 1830s used the term 'grauwacke' as a rock name and a formation name for their most ancient rocks. The English abandoned the name, but 'greywacke' remained useful in Scotland and began to be used in New Zealand in the 1890s. New Zealanders still refer to the association of semi-metamorphosed greywacke sandstones, argillites, minor lavas, cherts and limestone constituting the North Island ranges and the Southern Alps as 'the greywackes'. With the South Island schists, the greywackes make up 27% of the surface of the New Zealand landmass. They supply much of our road metal, but otherwise have little economic importance. Work on these basement rocks has rarely exceeded 10% of geological research in New Zealand.Leading geologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries competed to construct stratigraphical models for New Zealand where the greywackes were usually classified as of Paleozoic age. Controversy was generated by insufficient data, field mistakes, wrong fossil identifications, attachment to ruling theories and the inability of European-based conventional stratigraphical methodologies to deal with these Carboniferous to Jurassic rocks formed in a very different and unsuspected geological environment. After 1945, growth of the universities, increased Geological Survey activity, and the acquisition of more reliable data led to fresh explanatory ideas about geosynclines, turbidity currents, depositional facies, low-grade metamorphism, and structural geology. New interest in the greywackes resulted in the accumulation of additional knowledge about their paleontology, petrography, sedimentology and structure. Much of this geological data is stored in visual materials including maps, photographs, and diagrams and these are essential today for the interpretation and transfer of information.The development of plate tectonic theory and the accompanying terrane concept in the seventies and eighties permitted real progress in understanding the oceanic origin of greywackes within submarine accretionary prisms and their transport to the New Zealand region. In the last half century comparatively little geological controversy about the greywackes has taken place because of the acquisition of quantities of data, technological improvements, and the use of a dependable theory of the Earth's crust. Scientific controversy takes place when data and/or background theory is inadequate.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/90</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1213577</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Thromboembolic disease is a common cause of death in Western societies, predominantly affecting the elderly. Numerous risk factors and co-morbidities have been identified. Safe and effective means of prophylaxis are available but are underutilised.    Anticoagulant drugs are very effective in preventing thromboembolic disease, but their effects on the evolution of the thrombotic process remain poorly documented. These drugs are difficult to use, and treatment errors and treatment failures are common.    The factors which determine the embolisation of deep vein thrombosis are poorly understood. When such embolisation occurs it is usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism presents in 3 general ways-pleuritic pain, shortness of breath, or collapse. Tachypnea is the commonest sign.    Tests which are available to assist in the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease include the ventilation perfusion lung scan, ultrasound of the lower limbs, pulmonary angiography and echocardiography. The commonest investigation requested in this context is the lung scan. Although the results are often inconclusive, this is frequently the only specific investigation which is performed. The accurate interpretation of lung scans requires consideration of the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer assay is another test which may be useful. The finding of a normal D-dimer level substantially reduces the probability of thromboembolic disease and may render a lung scan unnecessary.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Medicine)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/91</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3085722</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1005380</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

It is implicated in the regulation of normal glucose metabolism and thought to induce pathological features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In particular, human amylin (hA) deposits as islet amyloid, and is associated with the loss of insulin-producing islet β-cells in NIDDM.    The biochemical mechanism of hA-evoked death in cultured RINm5F pancreatic islet β-cells has been investigated in this thesis. Synthetic hA but not rat amylin (rA) aggregated in aqueous solution, formed fibrils, and evoked β-cell death in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The cell death exhibited apoptotic features, including inter-nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial dysfunction, delayed membrane lysis, aurintricarboxylic acid suppression and cell membrane blebbling.    Cytotoxicity of hA was inhibited by Congo red (an amyloid-binding dye),  8-37hA fragment (fibril-forming but non-toxic), 1-40βA or 25-35βA (Alzheimer-associated peptide), but neither by sorbitol (inhibitory to hA fibril formation), rA nor its 8-37rA peptide (non-fibril-forming and non-toxic). Preformed large amyloid deposits of hA were less potent in causing β-cell death than small aggregates. These data suggest that hA induces β-cell apoptosis via small aggregates through a possible membrane receptor pathway.    Inhibitors of protein and mRNA synthesis did not inhibit hA-evoked apoptosis, but rather enhanced or directly triggered β-cell death during prolonged exposure. Likewise, Ca2+ modulators, which alter intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), failed to prevent hA cytotoxicity and were ultimately cytotoxic themselves. Fura-2 loading and 45Ca2+ uptake studies indicated that hA did not mobilise intracellular Ca2+ during its toxicity. These results indicate a protein synthesis- and Ca2+-independent process of hA toxicity RINm5F islet β-cells.    The studies reported in this thesis have established a new in vitro model of hA-evoked apoptosis using cultured RINm5F pancreatic islet β-cells. A new model of NIDDM pathogenesis is presented and discussed.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

The system, which is thought to have been active for at least 200,000 years, is situated over an area which has been volcanically active through time. Relatively recent local magmatism is found in the 800 m high, 3000-10,000 year old Mt. Edgecumbe dacite massif and the 200 m high Onepu Dome complex which lie adjacent to and within, respectively, the present day resistivity anomaly.    Shallow reservoir fluids show evidence of steam heating as expressed by elevated bicarbonate and/or sulphate contents and mildly to strongly acidic pH, whereas the deep fluids are dominantly alkaline at their respective temperatures. The calculated base fluid composition is comprised of 2.5 wt% CO$/sb2$ and ca. 890 mg/kg Cl at 310$/sp/circ$C.    Fluid inclusion studies show a largely stable, boiling point thermal regime through time, whereas oxygen stable isotope studies on hydrothermal carbonates prove the existence of one or more pulses of isotopically heavy fluids into the reservoir at some time(s) in the past. Hydrothermal alteration associated with these isotopic anomalies indicate strongly oxidising conditions relative to both alteration elsewhere in the reservoir and the present day reservoir redox conditions. Collectively, the data suggest a magmatic source for these transient, isotopically heavy fluids.    The present day system is ore forming, as evident from both metal rich scales formed in the production silencers of the geothermal wells and open fracture reservoir mineralogy. Stockwork environments in the deep reservoir are host to both base and precious metals, and evidence indicates that boiling is the main depositional mechanism for these ore phases.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>1987</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/94</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/8904865</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA105882</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

As a number of studies have shown that galectin-1 is a growth inhibitor (Wells and Mallucci, 1991; Manilal et al., 1993), the starting hypothesis for this thesis was that galectin-1 might be a substrate for a growth-related proteinase (GRP). The intention was to identify the mechanism of action responsible for this growth-inhibitory property by looking at the effect of galectin treatment on the expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene.    The structure of the recombinant galectin-1 molecule was investigated in mass spectrometry determinations. Galectin-1 was further characterised in hemagglutination, cellular growth, cytotoxicity, proteolysis and cellular degradation experiments. Even though the recombinant galectin-1 was not identical with the natural protein because it contained two pGEX-linker amino acid residues, and had an apparently 933 Da bigger molecular weight, it fully retained the carbohydrate binding and mitogenicity properties and was still a biphasic growth modulator.    Repeated DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry determinations of the tryptic peptides have accounted for all the galectin molecule and have not detected an insertion. We concluded that the abnormal size was the result of a calibration error in the mass spectrometer.    Even though the recombinant galectin was proved to be very susceptible to soluble proteinase action, there was no evidence for its active degradation when incubated with cells, and this disproved the original hypothesis.    We showed for the first time that $/alpha/sb1$-antitrypsin inhibitor (which inhibits the GRP) had a down-regulatory effect on c-fos expression. Galectin-1 treatment of U2OS and HELA cells had a downregulatory effect on c-fos expression, which confirmed the hypothesis that this proto-oncogene is affected by the signal transduction pathway through which galectin-1 inhibits cell growth. C-fos expression is affected in HELA cells even though they do not undergo growth inhibition, indicating that this process is not as simple as we initially believed. Galectin-1 treatment also downregulated galectin-1 gene expression.

I show how analysis of a popular musical phenomenon can be used to illustrate other social facts such as identity, political awareness, and alliance. American rap's history, musical characteristics, misogyny, profanity, racial implications, associations with deviance, and nihilism are explored, outlining multiple levels of meaning and intention, not excusing its occasional harshness, but presenting perspectives from within rap and critical race theory discourses. From interviews with school students, teachers, rappers, adults involved with young people and persons in the media industry, I show that, in Aotearoa, it is the Polynesian youth who have embraced rap, both as fans and as performers, from breakdancing in the early 80's to the latest surge of "Pasifika Hip Hop". Through observation and collection of videos, CD's, sales charts, magazines and news articles I conclude that American rap has had a strong presence in the media and popular music history of Aotearoa, with many local rap artists and songs having local chart successes. Through musical and lyrical analysis I summarise and compare the themes and musical influences of both American and Aotearoa rap and discover that Aotearoa rap is used to assert and construct local identities exploring race, culture and history. The thesis begs the question: Why is rap so popular particularly among Polynesian youth? Four responses are explored: a) The rappers themselves cite a similar socio-economic and historical circumstance to African Americans; b) Rap is a popular globalised popular cultural form, possibly representing a generalised trend in Americanisation and homogenisation, (which I refute on the basis of rap's inherent "blackness" arguing that hip hop is rather a voice of opposition); c) Rap as a genre has kaupapa [philosophy] and presents an ideal tool for the exigencies of Polynesian youth's exploration of identity and community and for the communication of political and pride; and finally d) The Polynesian youth of Aotearoa feel a spiritual connection to rap and hip hop, hearing something of themselves in it, and have taken to it like it was already theirs. I offer that rap has been a Turangawaewae [place to stand] for the rangatahi [youth] and they have injected this fertile African American popular music genre with their own culture and ideology.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted, but available by request, use the feedback form to request access.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Sociology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/97</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA936600</dc:relation><dc:rights>Whole document restricted but available by request.

Although we have only drafts of this play, the topic, the structure, and the relatively long time Lenz spent on the drama indicate that it was nevertheless an important work.    Over three chapters this study approaches the Catharina fragments in various ways, the main focus being on improving our understanding of the text. Before starting on the actual interpretation a few basic questions need to be examined, these relating to the conditions in which the play was created and developed, the choice of subject and themes, the manuscripts and their history, as well as the six editions of Catharina von Siena . For this reason the central interpretative chapter is prefaced by a chapter on the genesis of the play, as well as another chapter on the manuscripts and texts.    Since it was not possible to work with original manuscripts, a microfilm and reader print copies of the manuscripts were used. The textual examination was based on the readily available edition by Damm. Where necessary the reading by Titel/Haug and the older text editions by Weinhold, Lewy, Blei and Freye were used to supplement these, and also for the purpose of comparison.    A pluralistic methodological approach was applied. A more exact period of time for the creation of Catharina von Siena was defined, information about the way Lenz worked and about his intentions with regard to construction and effect was obtained as well. Through this detailed study of the fragments, correspondence and biographical data, we can establish reasons for the fragmentary character of the play, and are able to ascertain the special nature of the drama.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--German)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/98</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9923551</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA840697</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Globalisation and the knowledge economy are seen to fuel each other as well as driving trends in higher education. Internationalisation is shown to be intimately related to, but conceptually distinguishable from, globalisation, and to occur partly as a consequence of the latter (and of developments in the knowledge economy) but partly also as a response to these forces. All three phenomena are addressed through assessments of their dominant economic imperatives.    As a prerequisite to understanding and critiquing these forces and their dominant imperatives, the early chapters expound a further tripartite structure, this time of political-economic theories: neoliberalism, neo-Marxism, and Giddens' 'Third Way'. The lens through which the analysis is made is explicitly neo-Marxist. The thesis critiques the ascendancy of neoliberalism in the discourse of globalisation, and the knowledge economy and the internationalisation of higher education. Neoliberalism's ascendancy is shown to be promoted through global, regional, national and sub-national entities, and this promotion is found to be often covert.    The middle section of the thesis traces the effects on higher education of the economic, and specifically neoliberal or global-capitalist imperatives that the foregoing analysis reveals. Policies of deregulation, liberalisation, marketisation, privatisation and commercialisation are shown to exert largely negative influences on universities and, by extension, on other higher education institutions. They over-emphasise the private value of both knowledge itself and higher education as a knowledge agent, something which leads to a homogenising, devaluing 'commodification' of higher education. Having made the general case, the thesis then considers the Asia-Pacific region before focusing in depth on China and New Zealand. This structure makes for a macro-meso-micro approach to the development of the inquiry but with emphasis on the macro and the micro.    Key questions raised in the thesis concern the establishment of a 'counter-hegemony' to oppose the dominance of neoliberal principles and policies. The study culminates by recommending the emergent concept of interculturalism as both an accurate description of the intersection of cultures on campus and a desirable nonnative policy which should complement internationalisation as part of national and institutional response strategies. The thesis argues for the legitimation and encouragement of neo-Marxist interculturalisation and outlines its relevance to New Zealand higher education institutions, which host many international and new immigrant students, above all from China.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/99</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3189279</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1470932</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Building on Perner's (1991) theory of representational development, it is suggested that mind evolved from the ability to represent current reality (primary mind) to further entertain secondary representations of hypothetical content (collating mind) to finally represent representational relations themselves (metamind). In child development these transitions can be observed by about 18 months and by about 42 to 48 months. In comparative analysis only the great apes show signs of a collating mind. Young children and great apes can, for example, pretend, consider a limited future and past, solve problems by insight, and consider others' basic mental states. By about age four children begin to show evidence for metarepresentation in their ability to pass theory-of-mind tasks. At about the same age they also gain considerable executive control which, together with metarepresentation, is the key cognitive advance of metamind. Empirical evidence suggests that various skills co-develop with metamind and the thesis includes four studies that investigate such associations. It was found that gestural representation with imaginary objects and the generation of creative problem solutions were robustly correlated with theory-of-mind measures. These results substantiate the claim for a domain-general change in cognitive ability by about age four. Understanding delayed video feedback, however, was not found to correlate with such measures and it is questioned whether delayed feedback tasks measure an extended sense of self as has been proposed (Povinelli, 1995; Suddendorf &amp; Corballis, 1997). Great apes, while showing evidence for a collating mind, have not yet provided any convincing evidence for metamind. It is thus suggested that metamind developed after the split from the line that led to modern chimpanzees about five million years ago. Metamind, it is argued, was a prime mover in human phylogeny and is a crucial step in human ontogeny.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1998.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/100</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/9824385</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA698870</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Why have meaning and semiotics been of concern in architectural discourse? How did semiotics enter that discourse? How does it operate there?    The first chapter explores the notion of meaning in art, assuming this to have bearing on meaning in architecture. Functionalism is investigated as an implicitly semantic view of architecture: it is proposed that it is the failure of functionalism in practice which underlies the recent concern with meaning.    Chapter 2 introduces the work of eight semioticians: Saussure, Peirce, Morris, Mukarovsky, Jakobson, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, and Eco.    Chapter 3 poses the question of why semiotics has been attractive to architects. Attention is given to Tafuri's notion that semiotics serves both to bolster the current status of architecture (by blockading investigation of its discursive characteristics) and as radial criticism. Work by Norberg-Schulz and by Jencks is shown to be blockade; that by Agrest and Gandelsonas more nearly critical. It is proposed that semiotics and the discourse of modern architecture are epistemologically analogous, which circumstance has facilitated and been conditional to the entry of semiotics into architecture.    The fourth chapter examines Eco's and Preziosi's rigorous semiotic theories of the built. Both have been posited, however, as theories of architecture; as such they impede rather than foster theorizing with respect to architectural discourse.    Chapter 5 assumes a (semiotic) model of architecture as a hierarchy of codes (building, language, drawing, photography). The role of language in architecture is shown to be more important than is generally conceded. Architectural discourse is also shown to be dependent on photography, and, by implication, on other graphic modes.    While bearing in mind the links between the postmodern and radical strains of semiotics, the final chapter surveys architecture in culture's present postmodern moment. If the problematic of meaning in architecture has been motivated by the 'emptiness' of the built world constructed under the aegis of functional architecture, this problematic cannot be taken as a recuperation. Rather, the advent of semiotics in the discourse of architecture may signify its transposition to an unknown discursive configuration.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>1987</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Architecture)--University of Auckland, 1986.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/102</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/8812775</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA803039</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Utilising discourse analysis a social constructionist reading of men, masculinity and nursing is provided to offer an alternative reading to much of the extant literature with respect to men in nursing. The study draws upon a number of different sources of "text", including over 600 written works, two films and interviews with eighteen men who currently are, have been or are intending to be, nurses. Drawing primarily upon the "literary" textual sources a number of themes were identified for further exploration in interview with the coresearchers. These themes were the construction of masculinity, the construction of images of the nurse, the reaction to men who are nurses, sexuality issues, career development, and men and caring. The findings of this thesis reveal that the literature pertaining to men in nursing is replete with paradox and contradiction and fails to adequately account for the male experience. It is argued that the images and arguments provided in the literature with respect to men in nursing are based on out-of-date models and understandings of gender relations, masculinity and nursing. It is suggested that rather than enjoying patriarchal privilege, men who enter nursing must contend with being constructed as both an inferior man and inferior nurse. Their careers are not, as is alleged in the literature, based on developing "islands of masculinity" and male privilege, nor upon the avoidance of the emotional labour of nursing but reflect a belief that career is one way of doing care. It is argued in this work that men in nursing have fewer "taken-as-givens" upon which to base work and that they work to develop trusting relationships with their patients that are based on communication and empathy within a context defined by the patients' circumstances.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr. Judith Christensen</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Dr. Nicola North</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Nursing)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/103</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1575018</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Each year in Britain and the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of patients are injured, ten of thousands are killed and billions of dollars are spent on additional health care due to iatrogenic harm. Health care organisations remain predominately human-centred in their approach to safety-that is, methods of avoiding error rely primarily on the resolve and vigilance of individual clinicians to avoid bad outcomes. However, this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate in the face of the steadily rising complexity of modern health care and the increasing number of procedures carried out each year. In other high-reliability organisations such as aviation and nuclear power generation, safety results not from the sheer effort of “operators”, but from in-depth analysis of problems and the removal and redesign of dangerous aspects of systems-the so-called systems approach. Here I present an evaluation of the integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of the systems approach, intended to reorganise the way in which anaesthetists give drugs to improve performance and facilitate safe practice. The problem of drug error in anaesthesia is an important subset of iatrogenic harm in medicine. From the prospective study of 10806 conventional anaesthetics I define the rate of drug error in anaesthesia as one error in every 133 anaesthetics conducted-a rate five times higher than anything previously reported. In addition, anaesthetists rated the risk of harming a patient through drug error in the course of their career as high. I discuss the principles of safe system design, the psychology of error, and advanced systems safety concepts with respect to the design of the IDAS and the future of safety in medicine. In clinical use, the IDAS saved time before and during anaesthesia, and was rated by anaesthetists as significantly safer and more useable than conventional methods of drug administration. This work supports the hypothesis that error in anaesthesia can be reduced through the systematic analysis of its causes and the implementation of appropriate countermeasure strategies.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2004.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/104</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3170202</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1489187</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

Using qualitative data from multiple case studies within the New Zealand wine industry, the thesis captures and explains the strategic heterogeneity of diverse patterns of relationships and network interactions and how these are used strategically. Drawing on strategic management and business network theory, it emphasises how firms value their relationships in strategy, that is, how they contribute to strategy formation process and realisation outcomes. The study builds new interpretations and extends theory through in-depth exploration, providing two extensive typologies of relationships, one categorised according to the range of relationships, their functions, content and contribution to strategy, and another according to strategies and how relationships are used in their realisation. A model of relationship drivers in strategy is then developed, tested, and refined to show the purposes and outcomes of relationships and clarify the processes and conditions under which they arise and are used within an industry. The data support converging assumptions in strategic management and business network theory on the connectedness of firms in business relationships and the embeddedness of economic action in ongoing ties within social structures. Concepts of intentionality and emergence are used to show that emergence primarily arises out of intentionality.Understanding of relationships was based on the historically collective nature of the industry, on personal values, experience or approaches to relationships, on firm level strategy, especially decisions around grow, buy or connect options, and whether the firm aimed to control resources and activities internally or used relationships to achieve strategic goals. Firms focused on (in order of priority): resource-based input requirements, activity-based capability related strategies and actor-based values and these inputs operated at three levels which, singly or in combination, drove the diverse use of relationships: firm level strategy influences, relationship level influences and industry environment level influences. Two frameworks emerge which have strong explanatory power. One models how firms understanding and value placed on relationships is integrated into strategy processes. Another integrates concepts in a new way to show the main pathways through ways of understanding relationship development and use in strategy.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Marketing)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/105</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1497450</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Because there have been few studies examining resilience associated with postnatal (PN) depression, this study aimed at formulating and testing a theory-based model integrating both traditional resilience paradigms and non-traditional factors including existential beliefs about life, motherhood and religion.    Method. Study hypotheses addressed prediction of PN depression, stress and resilience, and the confounding influence of negative affectivity (neuroticism). Study variables included PN depression (Edinburgh PN Depression Scale, EPDS), stress, neuroticism, self-esteem, mother's distress and ambivalence, purpose/meaning, religious belief, parity, age, marital and social status. They were assessed with standardized self-report instruments and, following a pilot, administered to a probability sample of women four months postpartum in a one-wave, community, postal survey. Because the overall response rate was so low (49%) only the Europeans were included in the study (N = 225; response-rate = 78%). Statistical hypothesis-testing included linear and logistical multivariate model-twilding techniques, and principal components analysis.    Results. Sixteen percent scored in the major depression range (EPDS &gt; 12), and 14% in the minor depression range. Depression was associated with stress, neuroticism, purpose/meaning, mother's distress and (marginally) religious belief, but not with self-esteem, mother's ambivalence, age, parity or social class. Although neuroticism was strongly associated with depression, and also overlapped with most psycho-social variables, nonetheless stress, purpose/meaning, and mother's distress maintained significant relationships with depression after neuroticism was statistically controlled. Stress was associated in part with the perception of losing one's freedom in the motherhood role (neuroticism controlled). When resilience was defined as high stress coupled with low depression, it was associated with low levels of neuroticism and mother's distress. When resilience was defined in terms of high levels of maternal satisfaction, it was associated with high purpose and low ambivalence. Principal components analyses revealed that (1) stress scores reflected two dimensions suggestive of distress and self-efficacy; and (2) depression, stress, neuroticism, self-esteem and purpose were markers for the same underlying component, whereas mother's distress and ambivalence were markers for another (unrelated) component.    Conclusion. This study underlines the relevance of temperament, self-efficacy, self-transcendence, existential beliefs and motherhood-related cogniitions to the understanding of PN depression and stress.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Psychiatry)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/106</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3119441</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1217839</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

The imperial Crown has evolved into the New Zealand Crown, yet the implications of this change are as yet only slowly being understood. Largely this is because that evolution came about as a result of gradual political development, as part of an extended process of independence, rather than by deliberate and conscious decision.    The continuing evolution of political independence does not necessarily mean that New Zealand will become a republic in the short-to-medium term. This is for various reasons. The concept of the Crown has often been, in New Zealand, of greater importance than the person of the Sovereign, or that of the Governor-General. The existence of the Crown has also contributed to, rather than impeded, the independence of New Zealand, through the division of imperial prerogative powers. In particular, while the future constitutional status of the Treaty of Waitangi remains uncertain, the Crown appears to have acquired greater legitimacy through being a party to the Treaty. The expression of national identity does not necessarily require the removal of the Crown.    The very physical absence of the Sovereign, and the all-pervading nature of the legal concept of the Crown, have also contributed to that institution's development as a truly national organ of government. The concept of the Crown has now, to a large extent, been separated from its historical, British, roots. This has been encouraged by conceptual confusion over the symbolism and identity of the Crown. But this merely illustrates the extent to which the Crown has become an autochthonous polity, grounded in our own unique settlement and evolution since 1840. Whether that conceptual strength is sufficient to counterbalance symbolic and other challenges in the twenty-first century remains uncertain. But it is certain that the Crown has had a profound affect upon the style and structure of government in New Zealand.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Dr Raymond Miller</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Political Studies)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/107</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3002348</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA959736</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Simulation takes many forms, but this thesis refers only to whole patient simulators, where a computerised mannikin placed in a clinically appropriate environment is used to recreate a realistic clinical encounter. The focus of this work is the management of medical emergencies. Aim The overall aim of this body of work is to evaluate the effectiveness of simulationbased education across a range of different learners, and to investigate the properties of simulation-based assessment. In particular:  To review the literature on the effectiveness of simulation, and its use in assessment.  To evaluate the current status and effectiveness of CME interventions and the relative usefulness of simulation courses in this context.  To determine if simulation-based courses in crisis management can lead to changes in physician behaviour. iii  To evaluate student perceptions of learning in a simulator environment.  To assess students' ability to manage simulated emergencies, and their opinion of simulation-based assessment.  To define the psychometric properties and feasibility of simulation-based assessment in anaesthesia, the accuracy of self-assessment and the impact on learning. Methods and Results A number of different methods were used, which will be described in detail in the subsequent chapters. Overall, the results provide evidence for the effectiveness of simulation across a range of applications. Simulation-based assessment is acceptable, likely to have a positive impact on learning, and evidence support aspects of validity. Reliable scores can be generated but large numbers of cases are required. Conclusions There is sufficient evidence to recommend incorporating simulation-based courses into the acute care curriculum of medical undergraduates. Simulation is effective in CME in the context of anaesthesia crisis management and this is likely to apply to other acute care specialties. Like other clinically based assessments, extended testing time is required to generate reliable scores, limiting the feasibility of large scale, simulation-based exit examinations.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Professor Iain Martin</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (MD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/109</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1662418</dc:relation><dc:rights>Items in ResearchSpace are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated.</dc:rights><dc:rights>https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/docs/uoa-docs/rights.htm</dc:rights><dc:rights>Copyright: The author</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

My thesis addresses this question by formulating an endogenous growth model using the Cobb-Douglas production function.    My model disaggregates the rate of saving into the retention ratio and the household saving ratio and connects these ratios with three new parameters representing respectively the efficiency of financial institutions, the decision-making of managers, and barriers to technology diffusion. These three financial parameters make it possible to distinguish between quantitative and qualitative investments and to measure the growth rates of output, capital, and technological progress. Endogenous growth in technology neutralizes diminishing returns to capital.    The Cobb-Douglas production function assumes diminishing marginal productivity under constant returns to scale. My model, however, measures the growth rate of per capita output under the balanced growth state/constant returns to capital situation. This situation is guaranteed when the relative share of profit is within the critical relative share of profit. A set of combination of the three financial parameters holds under diminishing returns to capital, yet the diminishing returns to capital situation turns to the balanced growth state situation by using delta defined as the elasticity of quality improvement with respect to effective labour units attached to a machine. An extreme case corresponds with the Solow and O'Connell (including Harrod-Domar) models, where the three financial parameters are all 1.0, with no technological progress.    Simulation results demonstrate several new fact-findings. These fact-findings come from the characteristics of my model or the relationships between the growth rate of “per capita” output in the long-run (hereunder the growth rate) and the three financial parameters and delta, where the growth rate converges by setting delta =  the relative share of profit. First, if the rate of saving increases, the growth rate also increases linearly. This is more definitely evident than the result of Mankiw, Romer, and Weil [1992]. Second, under a fixed rate of saving, the growth rate changes significantly differently if each of three parameters changes: the relative share of profit, the growth rate of population, and the retention ratio.    In particular, the change in the retention ratio influences the growth rate positively or negatively depending on the relationship between the three financial parameters that reflect corporate behaviour and the nature of financial institutions. In this respect, I cannot find literature that relates the retention ratio or dividend policy to the growth rate in the Cobb-Douglas production function. Also the change in the growth rate of population does not influence per capita growth at all. This finding is also more definite than that found in the literature.    In short, the three financial parameters play an important role in economic growth. When we divide saving into corporate saving and household saving, the rate of saving as a whole is not independent of the growth rate. A proportion of corporate saving and a proportion of household saving are used for investment in quality, which accelerates productivity enhancement. Consequently, the characteristics of the corporate sectors and financial institutions of a country play a significant role in determining its long run growth rate of per capita income (even under a fixed rate of saving).</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.

A total of 517 Taiwanese EFL students from four educational levels were recruited for inquiring into the development of EFL writing. Quantitative analyses of writing tasks, vocabulary tests and questionnaires were used to describe and explain the multi-faceted nature of EFL writing in terms of the likely influencing factors.    Initially the contributions of respective factors were examined separately. Rhetorical analyses of students' English and Chinese compositions showed there were co-existing positive and negative influences of first language (L1) rhetoric on English writing. Analyses of lexical use and errors in English compositions, plus results from the assessment of two vocabulary tests, indicated that lexical and grammatical knowledge was a critical factor in explaining English writing. Results of students' Chinese writing abilities in relation to English writing proficiency revealed that the transfer of Chinese writing expertise was conditioned by a developed Chinese expertise and a lack of English writing experiences. Findings from the written-speech analysis of English essays suggested a transitional development whereby spoken language was used. Analyses of questionnaires indicated that EFL writing was positively related to attention on the macro-level structure and negatively related to micro-level concerns.    Subsequently, integrated analyses were conducted to examine the interplay among these factors. The shared variability of factors contributed a much larger portion to the explanation of developmental changes, suggesting that the development of EFL writing involves the interaction among influencing factors much more than the individual factors themselves. The unique contributions (independent of other interrelated variables) showed that essay length outweighed the other predictors, suggesting a need for instruction to develop the skill of fluency. A determining factor that consistently accounted for English writing performance was the students' levels of English learning and English writing experiences. The implication is that, particularly in the context where writing is neglected for beginning or intermediate learners, there is a need to revitalize writing as a communicative skill in the EFL curriculum.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2003.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/111</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3119448</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1592688</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

A considerable period of time was spent first on studying the roots of the two issues, asthma and New Zealand housing. The historical experience showed that health and housing problems at the national level in the 19 th century in England were solved by state interference.    The architectural background of this study created a need to cover some medical knowledge to understand the causes, symptoms and cure of asthma, if any. This knowledge was crucial while monitoring houses, designing the questionnaire, and analysing results.    Two stages of monitoring were achieved in 2000 and 2001. In addition to the monitoring, there was an attempt to find out as much information as possible about any issues related to the health conditions, especially the respiratory disorders, and the houses. The study of housing included building construction, house dust mite allergen levels in the carpet, building drawings, and other issues in preparation for the next stage of analysis.    The overwhelming quantity of information gathered about the 30 houses investigated in 2000 was so confusing that no statistical software package was seen as a perfect way for analysing it. It was decided then to establish comparisons between each factor investigated and asthma presence. Also, in most of the cases, the correlation between more than one factor with asthma rates was examined.    The investigation of the relations between many issues and asthma showed that there were links between asthma incidence and some indoor conditions of houses. Raised timber floors, which were found in most of the houses to be un-insulated, and in all the cases to be on unprotected ground, were found to have a strong relation with asthma incidence. In these houses, it was found that high asthma incidence was related to a higher level of moisture indoors. Asthma incidence in houses having old carpet, moulds, pets, or smokers indoors was higher than asthma incidence in houses without these. Old houses were found to have more asthma incidence than new houses. All the allergen levels in the carpets were extremely high and they were all above the allergen levels induced by house dust mites that can provoke asthma in susceptible individuals.    Based on the knowledge gained about the defective factors in housing affecting asthma, upgrading of the houses was designed. A house was chosen to be upgraded in three stages, each stage providing a different level of insulation. The upgrading costs were compared with the current national costs of health and heating to see what level of upgrading would be logical and cost-effective. National costs and savings were estimated in four cases each with different level of insulation. It was decided at the final stage of the study that insulating ceilings and floors in addition to other basic upgrading factors would provide savings in health and heating costs and would result in less CO2 emissions to the atmosphere of New Zealand.</dc:description><dc:description>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:20:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2002</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Architecture)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/112</dc:identifier><dc:source>http://wwwlib.umi.com/dissertations/fullcit/3061791</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1029351</dc:relation><dc:rights>Subscription resource available via Digital Dissertations only.

This approach allows mobile stations to simultaneously negotiate for resources from competing providers. We use an auction at each provider to decide on the resource allocation, based on the offers made by agents representing mobile nodes. All agents in the system try to maximise their utility gained from the total allocation of resources. The focus of this paper is on the bidding strategy of a mobile station when faced with the opportunity to obtain network resources from multiple sources. We support the proposed bidding strategy by simulation experiments, which show that the resulting allocation is efficient under the limited scope of the simulation setup.We also show that multiple-access can increase the allocation efficiency compared to the situation in which agents have access to only one network.</dc:description><dc:description>An open access copy of this article is available and complies with the copyright holder/publisher conditions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>IEEE</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T20:51:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T20:51:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Conference Paper</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>text</dc:format><dc:identifier>26th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, Lisbon, 04 Jul 2006 - 07 Jul 2006.

Applications will be able to dynamically adapt to the conditions and technical constraints of the network. This vision requires a dynamic allocation of scarce network resources to different users. This paper presents simulation results from a model of admission control and dynamic resource allocation in wireless networks, in a two-provider, multiple-user scenario. The access allocation and connection procedure is implemented using an efficient (welfare maximizing) incentive mechanism for capacity allocation at both providers.</dc:description><dc:description>An open access copy of this article is available and complies with the copyright holder/publisher conditions.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer</dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-11-30T20:51:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T20:51:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006</dc:date><dc:type>Conference Paper</dc:type><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>text</dc:format><dc:identifier>Mobility Aware Technologies and Applications, Second International Workshop, MATA 2005, Montreal, Canada, October 17-19, 2005, Proceedings.
