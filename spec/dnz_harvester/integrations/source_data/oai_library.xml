This knowledge has motivated substantial research and development into wireless signal transmission which today is competitive with traditional conductive cabling systems. Power transfer across air gaps, however, has seen more modest development and has tended to be restricted to electric machines that have tight magnetic couplings. It is only very recently that a novel technique termed IPT (Inductive Power Transfer) has made power delivery to movable objects across large air gaps a practical reality.</dc:description><dc:description>Whole document restricted, but available by request, use the feedback form to request access.</dc:description><dc:publisher>ResearchSpace@Auckland</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>Boys, John T</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2006-11-30T01:19:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Thesis</dc:type><dc:identifier>Thesis (PhD--Electrical and Electronic Engineering)--University of Auckland, 2001.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:relation>PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</dc:relation><dc:relation>UoA1013314</dc:relation><dc:rights>Whole document restricted but available by request.
